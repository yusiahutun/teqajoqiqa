As a first baseman, the athlete is responsible for fielding ground balls, defending the majority of games at the base, and catching throws from other infielders to take out a runner at first base.</p><p>The MLB player’s career path can boast a variety of awards/awards, including the following: Participant in the Arizona Fall League Fall Stars Game (2016), 2x National League Player of the Week (May 1-7, 2017, 19-25) June 19-25, 2017), Players Choice National League Outstanding Rookie (2017), California League Mid-Season All-Star (2015), Los Angeles Sports Council Sportsman of the Year (2017), Topps All-Star Rookie Team (2017), California League Post-Season All-Star (2015), National League Rookie of the Year Award (2017), Sporting News NL Rookie of the Year (2017), and National League All-Star Team (2017), and others.</p><p>On the field, Cody is known for hitting with his left hand and throwing left-handed shots. His MLB statistics for the 2018 season show the following records: Batting Average -.263, Home Runs – 64, and Runs Batted In – 173.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cody-Bellinger.jpg><h2><strong>Cody Bellinger’s Bio (Age)</strong></h2><p>The Dodgers’ first baseman was born on July 13, 1995, in Scottsdale, Arizona, as the middle child of Jennifer Bellinger and Clay Bellinger, a popular baseball player who played for the Yankees from 1999 to 2001 and spent four years in the Majors. After his time with the Yankees, Clay continued playing for the Anaheim Angels in 2002. He then moved to the Baltimore Orioles where he ended his career in 2004, although he did not make the roster. In addition to his baseball career, Clay is a volunteer firefighter and a real estate businessman.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Lance McCullers Jr Wife, Parents, Height, Weight, Age, Bio</a></strong></p><p>Cody Bellinger is a product of Hamilton High School and has an older sister and a younger brother, Cole, who is also a baseball player. He is currently experiencing the best moments of his young career with the San Diego Padres, after being drafted into the team in April 2017 in the 15th round. Cole is four years younger than Cody and graduated from Hamilton High School in Chandler, Arizona. He led the school to the state championship and scored 6.2 innings in a 6-4 clincher against Phoenix’ Pinnacle High. Although we hope that this will probably happen sometime in the near future, fans of the Bellinger brothers are eager to see them play against each other in the big leagues.</p><h2><strong>Family – Mom and Sister</strong></h2><p>There is no doubt that sustained support from the family greatly strengthens trust and success in sports. For many athletes, it is one of the most important weapons for building a flourishing career, and Bellinger is no exception. The outfield player’s family has been a crucial part of his life and career.</p><p>His mother, Jennifer Bellinger, is a Cabi stylist, while his sister, the oldest of Jennifer’s three children, is named Ashli Bellinger. Sports-loving volleyball player Ashli Bellinger studied psychology at Vanguard University in Costa Mes, California, where she also played on the school’s volleyball team. She currently lives in Chandler and was a big fan of the Texas Rangers, but that has probably changed since her younger brother joined the Dodgers.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Cody’s mother and sister are members of The Grove Christian Missionary Church in Chandler. While Ashli works as a large group coordinator for the Kids At The Grove and leader of the high school ministry, his mother serves as pastor of the children.</p><h2><strong>Cody Bellinger Girlfriend</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_37002 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-37002></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cody-Bellinger-Girlfriend.jpg><p>The baseball star allegedly dates a law student at the University of Texas-Austin named Melyssa Perez. Although it is not known exactly when the Los Angeles Dodgers and the beautiful Texas-born Friendswood began their relationship, the two lovebirds were spotted separately on the field.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Hyun-Jin Ryu Girlfriend, Salary, Height, Weight, Biography</a></strong></p><p>The beautiful Melyssa Renee Perez was born Melyssa Renee Perez and is currently working as a volunteer for an American law firm that provides legal services to low-income immigrants in central Texas, called American Gateways.
