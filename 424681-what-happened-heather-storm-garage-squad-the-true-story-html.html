So, what happened to Heather Storm from <i>Garage Squad</i>?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3381dfcfd86701f4.jpeg><p class=align-left>Fans of <i>Garage Squad</i> are familiar with the ever-gorgeous and charismatic Heather Storm. She was a co-host of the popular television series for five seasons before moving on. Unfortunately, her departure was not well-received.</p><p class=align-left>Fans have numerous questions about the event that left them without their favourite co-host. Why did <i>Garage Squa</i>d change hosts?</p><h2>Heather Storm’s journey in Garage Squad</h2><p class=align-left>Garage Squad <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">premiered in 2014</a>.

The charming host always worked on cars with her father when she was young. As a result, she started developing an interest in automobiles as young as 11 years old.</p><p class=align-left>Did she study anything to do with cars in college? Heather graduated with a bachelor's degree in Environmental <a href=#>Science</a> from Oregon State University. She worked hard trying to build a <a href=# title>career </a>for herself, and she found herself in Puerto Rico.</p><p class=align-left>Here, she took part in different modelling gigs, even becoming the Luxury Spirit portfolio manager. On top of this, Heather worked as a fitness instructor, created Black LAB, a boutique firm that got many commercials on TV. And that is how she landed the role of a co-host in Garage Squad, becoming part of the cast and crew for five seasons.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cd134c43c6ba9c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katie Holmes: Tom Cruise divorce story, dating, children, wedding</span></p></a><h2>What happened to Heather Storm from Garage Squad?</h2><p class=align-left>When <i>Garage Squad </i>returned for the sixth season, the loved Heather Storm wasn't part of the cast and crew.

Garage Squad is a stalwart of the MotorTrend line-up on both linear TV and the MotorTrend App. Entering season six is exciting, especially with the addition of Cristy. Her years of in-depth, 'how-to' automotive experience coupled with expertise as an interviewer/commentator in the automotive genre only stands to enhance the GARAGE SQUAD format.<p class=align-left>So, why did Garage Squad change hosts?
