She walked on the steps of her brother and tried her hand in gymnastics. Unfortunately, she was not good at it like her brother David. However, Allison did not lose her sports enthusiasm and opted to try something else.</p><p class=align-left>She found her passion and talent in pole vaulting, and that's how she ended becoming a pole vaulter.

She won the 15/16 US Championship record in 2004, the first of her many to win titles.</p><p class=align-left>As she continued growing her skill and talent, Allison found herself getting a seat at the table of fame for other reasons that did not include her pole vaulting career. It all began with a photo taken when she was 17 years old. A photographer took a picture of Allison Stokke as she prepared for a high school pole vaulting competition in 2007.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/89178de137d1cf78.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amanda Cerny bio: boyfriend, kids, net worth, nationality</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The photo was posted on California’s track and field website, and it immediately caught the eye of bloggers.
