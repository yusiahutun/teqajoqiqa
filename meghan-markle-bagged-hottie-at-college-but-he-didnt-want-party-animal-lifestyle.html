But the former <a href=#>TV</a> actress has dated a number of heartthrobs over the years. Even before tying the knot with the most sought royal bachelor, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>. Royal author Andrew Morton revealed in his book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess that the Duchess of Sussex was ‘quite the catch’ in her college days.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-bagged-a-hottie-at-college>Meghan Markle bagged a ‘hottie’ at college</h2><p>Morton reveals in his biography the Duchess dated college heartthrob Steve Lepore. He was described as “a white, six-foot-five-inch sophomore basketball player from Ohio” when she was studying at North Western University.</p><p>The couple made quite a pair. Although, soon after their romance started, Lepore accepted a transfer offer to Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and their love story was short-lived.</p><p>Dating the college ‘hottie’ wasn’t easy for Meghan, as Morton explained the differences between their lifestyles.</p><p>While Lepore had his early morning practices, so “he had to forgo partying,” Meghan was a ‘party animal’ on the weekends, he claimed.</p><p>Morton adds the romance between the two was short-lived for many reasons. Not only Lepore’s transfer, but there is no denying that both had a very different college life.</p><p>“She enjoyed the freedom that college offered away from her parents, but during the working week she diligently completed her academic assignments or babysit to earn extra cash,” Morton added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-511662-682x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-s-supportive-boyfriends>Meghan’s ‘supportive’ boyfriends</h2><p>Meghan has had a number of ‘supportive’ boyfriends in the past. One even practiced lines with her for auditioning, despite their short romance.</p><p>The Suits star dated actor and screenwriter Shaun Zaken in 2003. While the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> called off their relationship only after six months, reports claim Shaun was a very supportive boyfriend who helped Meghan’s Hollywood dream and practiced lines with her.</p><p>The now mom-of-two was open to dating <a href=#>celebrities</a> from her showbiz circle, as she reportedly was in a romance with a fellow actor, Brett Ryland for five months. Later, Brett became more famous as a writer for the super hit show Two Broke Girls.</p><p>Meghan also fell for <a href=#>movie</a> producer Trevor Engelson. The pair hit it off and tied the knot in a Jamaican wedding. However, one source claimed <a href=#>Meghan’s bold move came at the end of her first marriage</a>. The pair eventually called it quits, with the long-distance relationship believed to be one of the biggest hurdles. The Duchess was filming in Toronto for the TV show, while Trevor was back in LA.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aAcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55km5mXnLKleceoq62hlWKutXnCqKOlnZeaeqPB02afnmWUnrGvwIywmKesXaWus8DYZpinoZ2WuW64yJ%2BcrKypobJw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./melissa-mccarthy-april-2021-cover.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Melissa McCarthy Does It for the Laughs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./braided-ponytail-hairstyles-5374465.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>7 Braided Ponytail Hairstyles to Try Right Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
