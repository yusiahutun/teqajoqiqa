After spotting one still recording, he motioned toward his attorney, Kevin Shirley, before leaning in to whisper something into Shirley's ear.</p><p>As he did that, however, he instead elbowed Shirley directly in the face, before two bailiffs wrestled him to the ground. Shirley, meanwhile, said he was okay, quipping, "I used to box. I've taken a lot better shots than that."</p><p>Zieler was then taken out of the courtroom, before returning 10 minutes later. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The News-Press</a>, he "continued to growl and show his teeth, which appeared to have the word 'killer' scribbled on them," upon his return and maintained his innocence.</p><p>A request for a new trial was denied.</p><p>Zieler had previously been found guilty of the 1990 murders of 11-year-old Robin Cornell and her babysitter 32-year-old Lisa Story. His DNA wasn't matched to their murders until 2016, when he was jailed on an unrelated assault charge. According to prosecutors, the two victims were sexually assaulted; the girl's mother found the bodies in her Cape Coral apartment the next morning.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CBS News</strong></a>, the jury voted 10-2 in favor of the death penalty back in May; a judge Monday agreed with the jury's recommendation and sentenced him to death. Robin's family was seen breaking into applause after the sentencing in video posted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WINK</strong></a>.</p><p>"It's just been a dream for so many years, but here we are and to know that he will never be free is enough," said Robin's mother Jan in a press conference after the sentencing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29ma29fn7y0sc%2BhZLOhlaGys3nEpZmor6NirrXAzqulnrFdqLKvwMSnmp6cXZmyosDHaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./creative-craft-kits.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Get Creative With These Fun Craft Kits</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chefs-go-hong-kong-restaurants-superb-prime-rib-late-night-eats-and-seafood-after-hike.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A chefs go-to Hong Kong restaurants for superb prime rib, late-night eats and seafood after a hik</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
