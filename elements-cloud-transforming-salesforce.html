That is why Salesforce is seeing such growth. But customers have to balance the desire to deliver a huge vision with the practicalities of growth. The challenge is balancing agility with trust.

But building an app that will support the largest enterprises across the full scope of the implementation lifecycle and performs powerful analysis was not trivial. They’ve had a large development team working on the product for four years, adding functionality and honing the UI.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Phases of Consistency and Intelligence</h3><p>The company had been through four distinct phases which have now made it a go to product for Salesforce customers. These phases are:</p><p><strong>Design </strong>–Building the product road map, architecture and development approach.</p><p><strong>Free Offering</strong> –Elements made its process mapping a free offering, which proved a great success in comparison with other tools.</p><p><strong>First Paid Offering</strong> –They then added the first paid (PRO) offering to its list, which was the governance of process maps and the Salesforce metadata sync and analysis, which pulled in a more compelling ROI. Despite driven by low-touch marketing and sales, the company witnessed 10% growth month-over-month.</p><p><strong>Enterprise Offering</strong> – The Company introduced more sophisticated analysis, single sign-on (SSO), policy management and in-app feedback and help. This is a higher ACV and Elements has hired an enterprise sales team which is accelerating sales.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Meet the Cornerstones of Success</h3><p>Ian and the other two founders Adrian King and Richard Parker have one thing in common– 20+ years of experience of building enterprise application companies together. There is a shared vision, trust, and direction alongside providing a hassle-free work environment so the teams to thrive.</p><p>Enterprise apps like Salesforce need enterprise tooling like Elements.</p><p>The company is well-equipped with a pool of professionals that share the same interests and convert every challenge into an opportunity. These professionals are committed to their tasks and focus on delivering tangible results. They just roll up our sleeves and get stuff done. Besides, Elements.cloud is open and candid, and is politics-free.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about the company’s success the founders state that “We have a long-term product vision; we’ve listened to customers who have helped shape the product roadmap. We have been very focused on the Salesforce market so that we have been able to establish ourselves as thought leaders, supportive and responsive to the ecosystem.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Comprehensive Range of Products & Services</h3><p>The company supports the Salesforce implementation lifecycle across all the phases – Analysis, Build, Deliver, and Operate – with ease. Be it a small nonprofit or a Fortune500 corporation, competitive solutions are there to help customers run a successful Org.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In this digital world flooded with competitors and a wide range of disparate utilities, Elements.cloud stands tall as a one-stop-shop. Aggregating all the implementation data across the lifecycle in a single UI, the app provides a single source of truth and ensures the levels of security and governance demanded by CIOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To support compliance with GDPR, CCPA and other data protection regulatory governance, Elements developed a product that provides privacy and consent management to Salesforce data. Launched in 2018, Elements.cloud is now seeing a renewed interest as companies who are starting to put in place the proper technology to support regulatory requirements.</p><p>Discussing the long-term vision, Ian says that Elements.cloud can provide the implementation tooling for the CIO across all the apps in their IT estate: Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow, Oracle, SAP, GoogleApps etc. “We have already architected our app to do this. The limiting factor is only our go-to-market bandwidth, not the technology. Salesforce has over 200,000 customers, all of whom need our solution. That is a huge initial market.”</p><p>Any app needs to be affordable for the smallest non-profit.</p><p>Elements.cloud – <a href=# rel=noopener>https://elements.cloud/</a></p><p>For recent and latest updates regarding business news, industry trends etc. Please subscribe Newsletter from “<a href=#>The Enterprise World</a>” at “Subscribe”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLKtscyepa2rXZi5sMHDZqurmZ6os7C%2BzKKloGWjlrmmv8WoqZyd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nina-dobrev-looks-stunning-vibrant-yellow-ensemble-fitness-trainer-ben-brunos-star-studded-rehearsal-dinner-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nina Dobrev looks stunning in vibrant yellow ensemble at fitness trainer Ben Bruno's star-studded re</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./demi-leaves-rehab-after-just-5-days-fans-express-concern-on-soci.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Demi Lovato Leaves Rehab After Just Five Days; Fans Express Concern on Social Media</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
