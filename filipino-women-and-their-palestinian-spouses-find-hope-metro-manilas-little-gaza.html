Bejar, who bought chicken biryani and beef kebab, said he was eager to do his part in alleviating the plight of the families.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was a relief to see women and children having a safe place here in the Philippines. It made me emotional seeing the children having the chance to play,” said Bejar, who works at a migration consultancy firm in Laguna province.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another attendee, Jopie Sanchez, a creative freelancer from Quezon City, said it was important for her to show support for the families by taking part in the event.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/06/da9e66bb-4efa-451a-acda-2b71b76a8ced_26a35cdb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The food was very good and it gave us a glimpse into the culture of Palestine and their country.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kamilah Manala-o, another member of the collective, recalled the difficulties the families faced after landing in Manila. They were staying in the dormitories of the University of the Philippines for a short period and had to leave last December when government aid for them ended.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Manala-o regularly visited the dormitories and brought the families halal dishes and clothes. Her collective later helped them move to the shelter in Quezon City and pledged to pay for their basic expenses for at least the next six months and up to a year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our promise [to them] is that we will take care of the rent and bills so they can focus on picking themselves up and putting their children back in school … [and] focus on [finding] jobs,” she told This Week in Asia.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Filipino returnees from Gaza homeless as aid dries up: ‘they feel abandoned’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Several organisations that have been helping the families said the Philippine government’s refugee crisis response is inadequate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the first batch of families from Gaza arrived in November, they received cash aid of US$1,361 per family from the government. After being placed in hotels for three days, they found themselves without a place to stay.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Reverend Alan Sarte, secretary general of the Philippines-Palestinian Friendship Association – the organisation that helped arrange for the shelter in the University of the Philippines’ dormitories – said the government had failed to plan for the long-term needs of the Filipinos and their Palestinian spouses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the key challenges faced by government agencies is the absence of clear guidelines in dealing with a refugee crisis, said lawyer and Commission on Elections officer Nesrin Cali, who has been providing legal aid for the families.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">“</strong>Our existing system does not have the structure to respond to these situations. It could be a lack of funding or maybe our government officials don’t see it as a priority,” Cali said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/06/ce41a424-798c-4f1e-a0ba-10fc55a3c49a_2fe2fb31.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among the legal matters that Cali is helping the families with include voter registration for the Filipinos and employment paperwork for their Palestinian spouses. One such case is a Palestinian refugee who was a former assistant dean at a university in Gaza.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’re trying to get the Palestinian husband a spousal visa so that he can get the necessary work permit. These people are highly educated and they can be employed here but the problem is their paperwork,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Calling on the Philippine government to revamp its crisis response measures, Cali added: “There should be a responsive programme for refugees, especially since most of the Palestinian men are married to Filipinas and their children are Filipino citizens. It’s just sad that they didn’t receive that support from the government.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fudge Tajar, a Filipino-Iranian lawyer, organised a donation drive and a halal feast last December for the Palestinian refugees, as she was motivated to help them move on from their sufferings in the Israel-Gaza war.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You mourn those who died but you help the living because that’s how you could somehow give justice to those who were killed,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGprbWhlg3V7xaKjoqiZo7xuw86mnKdlkaOxbsDHnqCrZaCWuaa%2F06KlopmeYsCxu9SsnKxllp67pXnHqKeeZZ2awbO7jKaYp6GclsBuuMitq6WdXZyuu60%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./frasier-john-mahoney-loved-performing-154052.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Mahoneys Co-Stars Gush Late Actor Was a Delight and Loved Performing (EXCLUSIVE)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bachelor-zach-no-sex-in-the-fantasy-suite-rule-bites-me-in-the-ass.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bachelor Zach: No Sex in the Fantasy Suite Rule Bites Me In the Ass</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
