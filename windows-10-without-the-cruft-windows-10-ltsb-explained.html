The most unstable branch is&nbsp;the <a href=#>Insider Preview version&nbsp;of Windows 10</a>. Most Windows PCs are on the "Current Branch", which is considered the stable branch. Windows 10 Professional users have the option to "<a href=#>Defer Upgrades</a>", which puts them on the "Current Branch for Business". This branch&nbsp;will only get new builds of Windows 10, like the <a href=#>Anniversary Preview</a>, a few months after they've been tested on the "Current Branch". It's like the stable, consumer branch--but slower moving.</p><p>But businesses don't want all their PCs to constantly get big updates, even if they are delayed a few months. Critical infrastructure like ATMs, medical equipment, and PCs that control machines&nbsp;on a factory floor don't need whizbang features, they need long term stability and few updates that will potentially break things. A PC operating medical equipment in a hospital room doesn't need new Cortana updates.&nbsp;That's what Windows 10 LTSB--the "Long Term Servicing Branch"--is for, and it's only available for the Enterprise edition of Windows 10.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While this is a branch of Windows 10, you can only get it by installing&nbsp;Windows from Windows 10 LTSB installation media. You&nbsp;can get other branches of Windows simply by changing an option within Windows 10 itself, but that isn't the case here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_57e9f7c372982.png><h2 id=ltsb-gets-security-updates-for-10-years-without-feature-updates>LTSB&nbsp;Gets Security Updates for 10 Years, Without Feature Updates</h2><p>Because the LTSB version is&nbsp;designed for stability, it's updated very differently from other builds of Windows 10.&nbsp;Microsoft will never publish a feature update like the Anniversary Update or <a href=#>November Update</a> for Windows 10 LTSB. These machines will get security and bugfix&nbsp;updates through Windows Update, but that's it. Even when Microsoft releases a new version of Windows 10 LTSB with new features, you'll have to download new Windows 10 LTSB installation media and install or upgrade&nbsp;from the media. Windows 10 LTSB will never be automatically updated with new features.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to official documentation, Microsoft will typically release a new major version of Windows 10 LTSB every two to three years. That's what the&nbsp;documentation says, anyway--the current version of Windows 10 LTSB seems based on the Anniversary Update, so Microsoft is seemingly still&nbsp;changing its plans.&nbsp;You can also choose to skip releases--every version of Windows 10 LTSB will be supported with security and stability updates for ten years, according to Microsoft.</p><p>In other words, as&nbsp;<a href=#>Microsoft's documentation</a>&nbsp;words it, "The LTSB servicing model prevents Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB devices from receiving the usual feature updates and provides only quality updates to ensure that device security stays up to date."</p><h2 id=ltsb-doesn-t-include-the-store-cortana-edge-and-other-apps>LTSB Doesn't Include the&nbsp;Store, Cortana, Edge, and Other Apps</h2><p>Windows 10 LTSB omits a lot of the new stuff in Windows 10. It doesn't come with the Windows Store, Cortana, or Microsoft Edge browser. It also omits other Microsoft apps like Calendar,&nbsp;Camera, Clock, Mail, Money, Music, News, OneNote, Sports, and Weather.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, the&nbsp;default Start menu on Windows 10 LTSB doesn't even include a single tile. You won't find any of those new Windows 10 apps installed, aside from the Settings app.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_57e9fafa5a687.png><h2 id=microsoft-doesn-t-want-you-using-windows-10-ltsb>Microsoft Doesn't Want You Using Windows 10 LTSB</h2><p>Microsoft doesn't want people&nbsp;using Windows 10 LTSB on general purpose PCs, though. As Microsoft puts it,&nbsp;"LTSB is not intended for deployment on most or all the PCs in an organization; it should be used only for special-purpose devices. As a general guideline, a PC with Microsoft Office installed is a general-purpose device, typically used by an information worker, and therefore it is better suited for the [Current Branch]&nbsp;or [Current Branch for Business]&nbsp;servicing branch."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>LTSB is only for rare mission-critical devices.&nbsp;"It’s more important that these devices be kept as stable and secure as possible than up to date with user interface changes," explains the&nbsp;documentation. You might want your desktop PC to stay as stable and secure as possible without user interface changes, but Microsoft doesn't want to give the average Windows 10 user this option. Microsoft wants your PC constantly updated with new features.</p><h2 id=it-s-windows-10-enterprise-and-that-gives-you-more-control>It's Windows 10 Enterprise, and That Gives You More Control</h2><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Features Only Available in Windows 10 Enterprise (and Education)</a></span></p><p>Because Windows 10 LTSB is only available for&nbsp;the Enterprise edition of Windows 10, you also get&nbsp;<a href=#>all the Enterprise-only features</a>&nbsp;you can't get on the Home and Professional editions of Windows 10.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Enterprise edition gives you more control over <a href=#>telemetry data sent to Microsoft</a> and when Windows Update installs updates. It also lets you change some special group policy settings, allowing you to disable the lock screen. Beyond configuration, you'll find other useful features like Windows To Go, which allows you to install Windows 10 on a USB drive and take it with you so you can boot&nbsp;your own Windows installation on any PC you come across.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_57ea010398c28.png><h2 id=how-can-i-get-it>How Can I Get It?</h2><p>Sounds pretty good, right? Unfortunately, as we said earlier,&nbsp;Windows 10 LTSB is only available as part of Windows 10 Enterprise. And Windows 10 Enterprise is only available to an organization with a volume licensing agreement, or through&nbsp;a new <a href=#>$7 per month</a>&nbsp;subscription program.</p><p>Officially, if you're part of an organization with a volume licensing program, you're free to install Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB instead of Windows 10 Enterprise on your PCs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Use Slmgr to Change, Remove, or Extend Your Windows License</a></span></p><p>Unofficially, any Windows user&nbsp;can get Windows 10 LTSB if they want. Microsoft offers ISO images with Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB as part of its <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">90-day Enterprise evaluation&nbsp;program</a>. You can download the ISO file--be sure to select "Windows 10 LTSB" instead of "Windows 10" when downloading--and install it on your own PC. It'll function normally for 90 days, after which it'll begin nagging you to activate Windows and your PC will shut down every hour, according to Microsoft. You can, however, <a href=#>use Slmgr to "rearm" the trial for another 90 days</a>, and according to some users, this works up to three times, for a total of nine months.</p><p>Update: A previous version of this article said you could use Windows 10 LTSB past the evaluation period with only a few nag screens. This was incorrect, and we apologize for the error.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_57e9b526538a2.png><p>Windows 10 LTSB sounds exactly like what many Windows 10 users are asking for. Unfortunately, there's no legitimate way for the average Windows user to get it. That's no surprise--Microsoft doesn't even want businesses using Windows 10 LTSB for most of their PCs. So it probably isn't suitable for running as your daily driver anyway. But feel free to try it out if you're curious how Windows 10 would look without these features.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhpcGtoZ4Fww8inm6ivo2J%2BcXnWoquhp6WperW0xGaaq62WqXq4tc2dprCrXWZ9brjTrJlmnailuaK1zZ6baA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./case-review-rural-china-doctor-jailed-treating-sex-workers-2012-sparks-medical-ethics-debate-social.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Case review of rural China doctor jailed for treating sex workers in 2012 sparks medical ethics deba</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-shiv-marry-tom.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why did Shiv marry Tom?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
