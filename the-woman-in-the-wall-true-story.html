Her sleepwalking is a result of the trauma generated by her experiences. This was a common practice in the laundries; while preparing for her role, Wilson <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-66376157 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told the BBC" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">told the BBC</a> she was "shocked" by the treatment that young women received.

Many of the laundries – which operated throughout the UK, as well as in other countries across the world – were like workhouses, with regimes as strict as those found in prison.
