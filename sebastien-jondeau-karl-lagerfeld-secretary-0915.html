The first thing I do is drink water—Fiji or Evian—to clean my system. Then I look at my phone. I keep my phone a meter from my head, as it's not good for the brain to have it too close. If I go for a run after I wake up, I don't eat. I run between six and 15 miles, depending on what other sport I've done that week. I've always been a good runner. The best time I did for 14 miles was one hour and 50 minutes. For the most part, I'm not home in Paris, though. When I travel with Karl, we take the plane about twice a week—from the South of France to America or to Italy, then back to Paris. If we're in the south, we take the plane to work in Paris in the morning and then go back at night. Wherever I am, I try to exercise. Sometimes I just do abs and push-ups, but when I'm traveling I love to go running, to explore. If I have an early meeting with Karl, I'll go late at night. When I'm home I also do boxing training with my best friend. He trains people, and sometimes I train them with him too.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>11:00 a.m. </strong>After I get back from running, I'll have some cereal and plain yogurt. I drink regular American filtered coffee, like in the diners—I love it. When I'm in New York at the Mercer, I eat breakfast in the lobby after my training. And I always have a carrot juice; I don't like orange juice. I don't shave, really, as I have a beard. I use Nobacter shave gel. It's very good for the skin. My beard is going white now—I'm starting to look like Santa.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>11:30 a.m. </strong>My first conversation of the day is with my girlfriend [Jenna Courtin-Clarins]. We don't live together. We spend, say, two days at my home and a day at her home. We both travel so much, so we don't see each other a lot. At least we have some mystery.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>1:30 p.m. </strong>I ride my bike or walk to my office in the Seventh Arrondissement. For lunch I eat at the restaurant in Colette at least three times a week. There's a great mix of people at Colette—people from Paris, and people from the hood. I love that. I order an assiette verte [green plate]. Chicken, fish, grilled salmon. I don't have a lot of gluten. And rice. I eat a lot of rice.&nbsp;</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>3:00 p.m.&nbsp;</strong>After lunch I go back to my office. I have a few things to do for Karl there: organize things, pay some bills, hire people for projects.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>4:00 p.m.</strong> My first meeting with Karl is normally after lunch, unless we're traveling. Karl has maybe four iPhones; I have an iPhone and a BlackBerry—we use them all. I'll go over to his house or to Chanel. I've worked for Karl for more than 16 years, since I was 23, but I've known him since I was 15. My stepfather ran an 18th-century furniture business that I worked for sometimes, and Karl was a big collector. I was always asking Karl questions. He knows everything, and he was so much cooler than I was. I wasn't stupid, but I was curious. I came from a place in life where you don't really know that much. I did silly, bad things when I was young; I have so many stories. I became close with Karl because I was funnier than the other guys. I did my job, but I asked questions, and he liked that. It's a two-way street, you know?&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>5:00 p.m. </strong>Whenever I'm with Karl, I drive his car. We have two Rolls-Royces: a black one in Paris and a blue convertible in Monaco. No, Karl's hair doesn't fly out of his ponytail in a convertible. It doesn't move! At work, most of the time I'm in jeans and sneakers. My favorite jeans are Dior Homme. If I have an event with Karl, I'll wear a suit. Lagerfeld [Jondeau appears in the new men's campaign], Dior Homme, and all my three-piece suits are by Tom Ford. I love Tom Ford. I have a special room for dressing. I have one room at my place, and I have two at my office—imagine! But I don't keep everything. I give things to my friends from the hood. They don't have the money to buy a suit, but they look good, and they love it. They've been my friends since I was eight or nine, and they don't get to work with someone like Karl.&nbsp;</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I'm there to calm people down. Karl is the nice one; I'm the bad one." <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>7:00 p.m. </strong>Karl is a hard worker. He's always doing something. We're working on a collection for Chanel or Fendi or Lagerfeld; he's a photographer—there are so many things. Karl's brain is greater than all the computers in the world. Sometimes I think, "What the fuck? How does he do all of this?" I have three lives: my own; my second life, with Karl; and my third life, with my girlfriend. It's very important that I do my sport—I run—because I have to protect Karl. If I don't, I feel I'm not as good as I used to be. I remember years ago when Karl and I were at the CFDA Awards. PETA people started throwing things at him. I knocked one of the guys to the ground. It was crazy. (By the way, Choupette doesn't have to worry about security. She never goes outside, unless she's traveling with us. No risks for her!) When I'm done with work, I have some time for a private life.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>9:00 p.m. </strong>Most nights I have dinner with Karl. If we're in Paris, we eat at his place or a restaurant, but we usually eat at his place because he's not crazy about restaurants. It's sometimes too public in a restaurant, but I'm there to calm people down. Karl is the nice one; I'm the bad one. He will talk to anyone: presidents, queens, cleaning ladies. But I have to keep him moving. Sometimes people from the press are too much—they are pushing, pushing, asking things. It's like he's an emperor. People in fashion, some of them act like they're saving the world or something. You go to the hospital, that's where you're going to see people who save the world. I don't spit on fashion; I'm in the fashion business. It's just some people, you know?&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>11:00 p.m.</strong> If I go out at night, I often go to the VIP Room in Paris. They have a restaurant called La Gioia, owned by my friend Jean-Roch. He also owns the VIP Room in St.-Tropez. (He's one of my best friends; we're like brothers. People always say you can count your brothers on one hand, but me, I need a few hands.) I don't drink, but if I have a glass of wine it's Cheval Blanc or Château d'Yquem only.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>VACATION:</strong> On holiday, I'm with Karl in the South of France. It's like 75 percent holiday. I do what I have to for him, then I'm doing bikes, motorcycle, Jet Skiing. I jump from the plane, you know? Now that I'm working and I have more money than I used to, I can have more toys. But it's good to keep your head. In my world my head could inflate, I could forget where I'm from and what is the reality. Of course, I don't live in the hood anymore. I live in a nice place in Paris. I am so lucky, you know? I never forget.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaaaWFufnV70p6ZmquknrKvecmopZ2dkap6rK3RpWSlmZeav6exy51krJ2Tp7K1rdGyZGlxYWp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hunter-hayes-love-life-dating-apps.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hunter Hayes Is Looking for Love, But Not on Dating Apps</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marc-bendavid.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marc Bendavid Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Facts, Nationality</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
