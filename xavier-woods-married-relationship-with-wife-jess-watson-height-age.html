As part of the trio The New Day with Big E and Kofi Kingston, Xavier Woods has won two Raw Tag Team Championships and two SmackDown Tag Team Championships. Their second RAW championship became the longest tag-team title reign in WWE history. Beyond wrestling with The New Day, Xavier Woods is an all-rounder, as we will show in this article.</p><h2><strong>Xavier Woods Bio (Age and Background Details)</strong></h2><p>Xavier Woods is not his real name, it’s a ring name. It is actually his fifth ring name, others are Austin Creed, Consequences Creed, and Rasheed Lucius Creed. He also used his birth name Austin Watson as his ring name. He was born on September 4, 1986, in Columbus, Georgia.</p><p>Watson debuted as a professional wrestler in 2005, one year after graduating from Sprayberry High School. He started with NWA Anarchy and adopted the nickname Austin Creed, which was influenced by the Rocky series character Apollo Creed. After two years with NWA Anarchy, Watson joined TNA in 2007 and adopted the ring name Consequences Creed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Xavier_Woods.jpg><p>At TNA he teamed up with R.Truth (real name Ron Killings) and as a team, they became known as Truth and Consequences. After his release from TNA in 2010, he had a short stint in New Japan Pro Wrestling before signing with WWE in July 2010. In WWE, Watson originally used his real name for his ring name before adopting Xavier Woods.</p><p>After a period of little to no success with his former TNA colleague R. Truth, Woods joined another unsuccessful tag team of Kofi Kingston and Big E to form The New Day in 2014, and it wasn’t long before they became fan favorites and sparked a revolution in tag team wrestling.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Ricky Bell (singer) Wife, Kids, Mom, Siblings, Family, Height, Age</a></strong></p><p>Most WWE athletes are high school and/or college dropouts, but Austin Watson is far from the average WWE wrestler. Despite his tremendous wrestling activity, Watson found the time to earn not one, but two college degrees. He has a bachelor’s and master’s degree from Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. But that’s not all, Watson also has a Ph.D. in educational psychology from the online institution Capella University.</p><p>Austin Watson once told The Bleacher Report that he hopes that his focus on his academics can inspire young children to stay in school.</p><p>In 2015, Watson added a YouTube personality to his repertoire after founding a YouTube game channel UpUpDownDown, where he addresses himself with his first ring name, Austin Creed. The channel quickly gained over 1 million subscribers. Xavier Woods is an avid gamer and even has a Twitch account.</p><h2><strong>Married, Relationship with Wife, Jess Watson</strong></h2><p>Much is known about Xavier Woods of the WWE and the educational side of Austin Watson, but the same cannot be said about his personal life, which he keeps completely under wraps.</p><p>It is a known fact that Woods is married to a certain Jess Watson and has been since October 2015. After keeping silent about WWE for a while, reports appeared that the break actually served to tie the knot with Jess.</p><p>The couple kept their relationship secret and the public did a good job of respecting their privacy until lewd photos and videos of him and his WWE superstar Paige were leaked online in March 2017. Woods was seen having sex with Paige, while another WWE star, Brad Maddox, was the cameraman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Xavier-Woods-and-Paige.jpg><p>The fans were not only worried about his stay in the WWE but also wondered what effect the video would have on his relationship with his wife Jess Watson. Well, the video may have done little to influence his marriage, as it may have been made before his marriage and/or relationship with Jess. How can we know that? Well, for one thing, one of the leaked photos showed Paige’s NXT championship title, which she won in 2013.</p><p>For another, it could have been in the time when Brad Maddox was still in the WWE, which means that the time could be before November 2015 when he was fired. However, this remains pure speculation and the world may never know how the leak affected his marriage.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Andrea Russett Bio, Height, Age, Girlfriend, and Other Facts You Need To Know</a></strong></p><p>While it is not clear what effect the leak had on Woods, it was terrible for Paige, who admitted that the leak drove her to suicide and put her in the hospital because she was suffering from “stress-related anorexia.</p><p>Woods’ wife, Jess Watson, revealed in December 2016 through a now-deleted Instagram account that she was pregnant and that her child, whose father is Woods, would come in May 2017.</p><h2><strong>His Height and Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>Xavier Woods is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall. He weighs 93 kg and other details of his body measurements are given below:</p><p><strong>Chest Measurement</strong>: 55 inches</p><p><strong>Biceps:</strong> 20 inch</p><p><strong>Waist Measurement:</strong> 36 inches.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kxaLCyJ6pZq%2BfpLG0ecyaqauhlZl6s7HLmquip56otaq8jLCgraBdrLansYyjnKyrXayutb%2FOp2ShnZmctbV5wKCcaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./glass-onion-ending-explained-spoilers-recap-knives-out-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery' Ending, Explained</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rahman-dukes-named-head-of-urban-programming-at-livexlive.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rahman Dukes Named Head Of Urban Programming At LiveXLive</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
