CyberSecOp is a leading CMMC-AB RPO & ISO 27001 Certified provider of security solutions and services for the world’s most security-conscious agencies and organizations.&nbsp;</p><p>As CEO, he orchestrates the company’s support of corporations and government agencies worldwide in cyber security, secure mobility, and identity management. Vincent has been with the company since 2001, operating under the company name INSC; and is a leading voice in bringing together the private and public sectors to address cybersecurity issues.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Record of Vincent LaRocca’s Professional Journey</h2><p><strong>Vincent LaRocca</strong>&nbsp;is an accomplished information technology professional with over 25 years of experience in the high-tech industry, providing managed security services and managed IT services for SMB to Fortune 500 companies. His keen business acumen spans across&nbsp; P/L, revenue growth, negotiation, presentation skills, resource allocation, strategic business development, and delivery methodologies.&nbsp;</p><p>Vincent LaRocca, fondly known as Vinny, had early career success working for IBM and EMC where he spearheaded new initiatives in data migration, business continuance, systems implementation, and best practice management. It was at that point that he started to contemplate the idea of starting his business with a friend, quickly realizing that between the two of them, they had six or seven clients, so they started an MSP called Innovative Network Solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>It was about six years ago when the duo realized that MSPs could not serve as both the Technical and Cyber Security Governing body for an organization, so it was time to launch an MSSP that would only focus on Cyber Security and Cyber Security compliance. With Vincent’s experience and sales success, he built&nbsp; out the organizational structure of the company but needed help with the nuts and bolts of Cyber Security. Fortunately, those services were in high demand and the timing was perfect to partner with Jeffery Walker who had a strong Cyber Security background. Together, they created &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an MSSP working in partnership with small to Fortune 500 customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Identifying the right partners has been one of the key achievements of Vincent’s entrepreneurial journey. He adds, “I have seen many organizations fail because partners or executives were not on the same page. I was fortunate enough to team up with some great individuals to build several successful organizations without ever acquiring any debt.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Unveiling the Responsibilities of an Entrepreneur</h2><p>As a leader and entrepreneur, Vincent LaRocca believes in taking care of those who participate in the success of one’s business. He states, “If you take care of your partners and employees, they will take care of you. It is also important that an entrepreneur understand the industry they play in and the changes that come along with it so they can adapt to those changes to stay relevant.”</p><p>Cyber Security has been Vincent’s career passion. Before founding CyberSecOp, he held positions of increasing responsibility at IBM, EMC, and Dell. He was CEO of Innovative Network Solutions Corp. from 2010 to 2018. Through these varied experiences, he learned how different players in the industry—like MSSPs and MSPs—can complement each other’s efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>Vincent LaRocca is a frequent speaker at industry and government events. He reviews how virtually every organization has employee, health, or financial information and needs at least some basic protections in place to avoid being seen by hackers as low-hanging fruit. More broadly, he seeks to bring the public and private sectors together to address key cybersecurity issues—confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>About CyberSecOp</h2><p>CyberSecOp provides high-end, industry-leading cybersecurity consulting and incident response services for organizations worldwide.
