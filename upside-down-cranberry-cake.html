I wonder if Knopf will find this so hilarious) finished with that it’s taking time away from hanging out here.

Yesterday, I made what I hoped would be an unfathomably deep apple pie for the cookbook. Think piles of amazing baked appleness for people who can never have enough filling (<a href=#>this</a>, by the way, is for people who can never have enough crust). Alas, it was a (delicious) mess and I am back to the drawing board where I summon the confidence to start peeling another six pounds of apples.</p><p><a title="sour cream batter" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1130/5151328182_5c04c90a51_z.jpg alt="sour cream batter" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a title="cranberries meet caramel" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4108/5151333032_f5d9ae36cb_z.jpg alt="cranberries meet caramel" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>There’s also this upside-down cranberry-caramel cake, which I made from <a href=#>The Perfect Finish</a>. Now, before I tell you everything that went wrong with it, I’d like to start off on a positive: we finished it. In an apartment with too much of everything caloric these days, the temptation of cake isn’t particuarly strong (if there could be an upside to all of this cooking). But over the course of a workweek, we finished it. Obviously, it was good.</p><p><a title=baked href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1203/5150727497_26607692df_z.jpg alt=baked data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>But it was troublesome. It baked too quickly, I found the cake a little sturdy. It almost overflowed. I wanted more flavorings to contrast the cranberries and I wanted a few more cranberries, too. And the cake, it’s not very pretty. At first I blamed my photography but then I started insecurely Googling (what, doesn’t anyone else do this?) other images of cranberry upside-down cakes and well, apparently they largely look like this. I’m going to post the recipe below with a bunch of notes. Feel confident that if you make it by the book, with only minor adjustments for cooking time and oven protection, you will have a cake worth sharing and finishing. If you’d like to raise the bar on it, however, I’ve got some ideas.</p><p><a title=flipped href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1219/5150731459_c5f26e61ed_z.jpg alt=flipped data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Raisin-Studded Apple Bread Pudding</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Cottage Cheese Pancakes</a> and <a href=#>Onion Tart with Mustard and Fennel</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Roasted Stuffed Onions</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Indian-Spiced Vegetable Fritters</a></p><p><b>Upside-Down Cranberry-Caramel Cake</b><br>Adapted from <a href=#>The Perfect Finish</a> (<a href=#>previously from this book</a>)</p><p>If you don’t like molasses, I’d use honey or light corn syrup instead because although just a tablespoon, you can taste it (though we found it delicious against the tart berries). If you’re thinking, as I was, that there was no need for a parchment paper circle in the bottom (and later, top) of the pan, you can probably skip it. The “probably” is there because I didn’t get to retest this without it but see nothing to worry about; if a berry sticks, just scoop it and plop it on top of the cake. The cake itself is a little on the shortcake side — sturdier than your average plush layer cake but still quite moist. Still, if you want a more traditional upside-down cake base, I think <a href=#>this one is phenomenal</a> (you might even swap the pineapple juice for white cranberry) as is <a href=#>this one</a>.</p><p>Unsalted butter or cooking spray for the baking pan<br>2/3 cup (5 ounces or 142 grams) packed light brown sugar<br>12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks, 6 ounces or 171 grams) unsalted butter, melted<br>1 tablespoon unsulphured molasses<br>2 cups (8 1/2 ounces or 242 grams) all-purpose flour<br>1 cup (7 ounces or 198 grams) sugar<br>2 teaspoons (9 grams) baking powder<br>1 teaspoon salt<br>3 large eggs, at room temperature<br>1 cup (8 1/2 ounces or 242 grams) sour cream<br>2 cups (8 ounces or 230 grams) fresh or frozen cranberries (you could add a half-cup more, if you, too, can never have enough cranberries)<br>Optional flavorings: 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, 1 tablespoon orange or lemon juice or 1/4 teaspoon zest, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, few gratings of fresh nutmeg or a combination thereof<br>Whipped cream, optional</p><p>Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter and cover the bottom with parchment paper (see Note above). In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the brown sugar, 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) of the melted butter, molasses and 1/4 cup water and bring to a boil. Stir well and pour into prepared cake pan. Set pan aside.</p><p>Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt together into a bowl or onto a sheet of waxed paper and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixture fitted with the whisk attachment (eh, I just used a handmixer with standard beaters) beat the eggs and sour cream together at medium speed until well blended. Add optional flavorings of your choice. Scrape down the bowl and add remaining melted butter (1/2 cup) and beat until combined. Add flour mixture and beat until smooth.</p><p>Add the cranberries to the prepared baking pan and gently press the fruit into an even layer. Dollop the batter on top and use an offset spatula to gently nudge it into place without disturbing the cranberries underneath. Bake on the center rack (with a tray underneath to catch drips… just in case; mine did not overflow but came stressfully close) until golden and a tester inserted into just the cake comes out clean, which took 30 to 35 minutes in my oven but is suggested to take 45. Please, <i>please</i> check yours on the early side. Remove from the oven and let cool in pan for 15 minutes. Run a thin knife around the inside of the pan then insert over a flat platter that is (Learn From My Mistakes Alert!) larger than your cake pan, to catch any puddling or jumping cranberries. Remove the parchment paper.</p><p>Serve warm, with freshly whipped cream. However, this cake wasn’t half bad two to three days layer, kept covered at room temperature.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-6923 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-6923 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
