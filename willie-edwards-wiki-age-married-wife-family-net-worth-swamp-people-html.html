But how much do we know them in person?</p><p>Being on the show, Willie made&nbsp;fearless maneuvers to catch big alligators and appeared as a good son for not reacting to his father's yells and shots targeted to him.</p><p>We have encountered many of such situations between the dad and son on screen, but we still lack much more things about the Edwards. Today, we shed some light on the life&nbsp;beyond the screen of the duo in this wiki-like bio of Willie. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>The Family Background Of Willie Edwards:</h2><p>Willie Edwards belongs to a small family and is the only son of his parents.
