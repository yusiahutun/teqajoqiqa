He initially joined as a quarterback but switched to the tight end position during his college career. This transition allowed him to utilize his size and athleticism to become a reliable receiving target. He had a breakout season in 2012, his senior year, where he recorded 45 receptions for 722 yards and 8 touchdowns, and this performance helped boost his draft stock for the NFL.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-nsync-taylor-swift.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-jason-retire.jpg><p>Kelce was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft, as the 63rd overall pick. Since then, he has risen to become one of the league’s most dominant and prolific tight ends, but <a href=# id=auto-tag_travis-kelce data-tag=travis-kelce>Travis Kelce</a>’s contract perhaps is not the fairest representation of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>all he’s done (and his girlfriend by extension) for the game</a>.</p><p>But on Super Bowl Sunday 2024, the Kansas City Chiefs got off to a rough start. At halftime, the 49ers led 10-3 and Kelce had been kept to just 1 yard. Here’s <a href=#>why Travis Kelce was yelling at coach Andy Reid</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=travis-kelce-yelling-at-coach-andy-reid-video>Travis Kelce yelling at coach Andy Reid video</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/travis-kelce.jpg><p><a href=#>Travis Kelce yelling at coach Andy Reid went viral</a> in the second quarter of the Super Bowl. Kelce, having a very quiet night himself, was off the field at the time of a fumble by Isiah Pacheco. Kelce demanded he be put in the game through some pretty aggressive tactics.</p><p>The tight end could be seen yelling and shoving Ried, causing the legendary coach to lose his balance slightly. Kelce was held back by teammate Jerick McKinnon, who quickly dragged him away—we hope to help him cool off. It’s not clear what Kelce was yelling about but commentators suspected</p><p>“After the fumble, he [Kelce] comes over to Andy, he goes, ‘Keep me in!’ What happened is, on the fumble, he was not in the game [tight end] Noah Gray went in … I think Kelce knows he’s like, ‘Just keep me in there!’” one broadcaster theorized.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>For once, the cameras did not pan to Taylor Swift for her reaction. Swift has been a fixture at&nbsp;<a href=#>many of her boyfriend’s games</a>&nbsp;since their relationship went public in September 2023, when she showed up for their win against the Chicago Bears.</p><p>While appearing on&nbsp;The Pat McAfee Show&nbsp;on Sept. 21,&nbsp;Kelce revealed&nbsp;that he had invited Swift to watch him play football since he’d already seen her in concert. “I threw the ball in her court. I told her, I’ve seen you rock a stage in Arrowhead and you might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead,” he said. “We’ll see what happens in the near future.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=travis-kelce-responds-to-yelling-video>Travis Kelce responds to yelling video</h2><p>In an interview with AP following the Chiefs Super Bowl victory, Kelce deflected questions on him yelling at his coach. “<a href=# rel=nofollow>You guys saw that?</a>” Kelce said. “I’m going to keep it between us unless my mic’d up tells the world. I was just telling him how much I loved him,” he quipped.</p><p>Reid said Kelce just wanted to be on the field. “There’s nobody I get better than I get him,” Reid said. “He’s a competitive kid. He loves to play. He makes me feel young.
