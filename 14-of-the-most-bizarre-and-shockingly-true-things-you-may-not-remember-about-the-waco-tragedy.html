They probably recall some of the strange sex rumors that came out of the compound, because that's just the way people are. But there's so much more to the story than that.</p><p>Following are 14 of the most bizarre and tragically true things about the Waco siege.</p><h2 class=h2>Vernon Howell</h2><p>Many people might think that the Branch Davidians were named after their leader, David Koresh, but the exact opposite was true. Koresh was born Vernon Howell, and the Branch Davidians were born in 1955 as a splinter group from the Seventh-day Adventist Church of the Shepherd's Rod. After gaining control of the church, Howell petitioned to have his name legally changed to David Koresh "for publicity and business purposes."</p><h2 class=h2>Corpse Resurrection</h2><p>The church split when its leader Lois Roden chose Koresh over her own son George as the heir apparent. George split off his own group and after Lois' death, he challenged Koresh over leadership by digging up a body and suggesting they have a corpse resurrection contest. George retained control of the Mount Carmel Center where the original church was held.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c8b7f05e-94bc-52f1-a1c2-819a28241845 data-container-ref=toofab:article:86933620-8a33-509b-bb7f-433173fbf9e3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b3/5by4/2018/01/17/b3ad8ac4aadd57e19aa516d1d9420822_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">FX</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Darren Criss Is Compelling as Versace Killer in Somewhat Unconvincing 'American Crime Story': TooFab Review</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Rodenville Eight</h2><p>Koresh attempted to get a picture of the unearthed body as evidence against Roden, leading to a gunfire dispute and the injury of Roden. Koresh and seven associates were dubbed "The Rodenville Eight" by the local media and tried for attempted murder in 1988. Seven were acquitted, with Koresh receiving a hung jury verdict.</p><h2 class=h2>Axe Murderer</h2><p>Roden killed a Davidian who had come to him with a vision that he had been proclaimed God's messiah with an axe. He was declared guilty by reason of insanity, leaving Mount Carmel available for Koresh to obtain after he paid the back taxes on it.</p><h2 class=h2>House of David</h2><p>In August of 1989, Koresh released the "New Light" audio tape where he said God had told him to have sex with all the women in the group, while their husbands needed to be celibate. Koresh's children would help create a "House of David."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:80ae0d69-d88b-5da6-9e7a-020ddc746d18 data-container-ref=toofab:article:86933620-8a33-509b-bb7f-433173fbf9e3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4d/5by4/2017/10/25/4debbbc846185a5ca47df7b9ae987042_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/California Department of Corrections</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Erik Menendez Breaks Decade-Long Silence on Murders: 'I Think It's Time People Hear the Truth'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>UPS</h2><p>The government got involved after a package delivered by a UPS driver broke open, revealing firearms, grenade casings, and black powder. The driver reported this to the company, which contacted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) in May 1992. This initiated an investigation into the compound and the church.</p><h2 class=h2>ATF University</h2><p>The Branch Davidians never fell for the ATF's attempts at surveillance, which included renting out a house across from the compound under the guise of being local college students. Unfortunately, the undercover agents were in their 30s, were not registered at any colleges and didn't even try to have a college schedule.</p><h2 class=h2>The Sinful Messiah</h2><p>The ATF was forced to act when the Waco Tribune-Herald launched a series of articles on Feb. 27, 1993, alleging that Koresh had taken multiple underage brides and was committing acts of child abuse and sexual abuse within the compound. The government had asked the newspaper to delay publication until they could be ready, but after multiple delays and with no strike launch in sight, the paper published.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4055c8f4-47d1-5d80-b36b-568a625c03d2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:86933620-8a33-509b-bb7f-433173fbf9e3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bd/5by4/2018/01/24/bded4da4fe5e5613820790ab4c250ab5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Erykah Badu Sticks Up for Hitler, Cosby, Trump and Twitter Is as Angry as You'd Expect</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Prep Time</h2><p>The ATF raid was intended to be a secret, but Koresh found out about it because an agent who had infiltrated the Branch Davidians was almost immediately identified. Despite the compound knowing the raid was coming, ATF moved forward with it, allowing them time to arm up and prepare for the raid.</p><h2 class=h2>Who Shot First?</h2><p>To this day, no one knows definitively who shot first. Davidians claimed it was the government, with one of them even calling 911 a minute after the raid began saying, "Here they come again! That's them shooting! That's not us!" In that initial raid, four ATF agents were killed, and five Davidians were left dead. Another Davidian was killed hours later, with reports from ATF that he was trying to sneak out, while his wife said he was returning from work.</p><h2 class=h2>Slaughtered Rabbits</h2><p>After the failed siege, the FBI attempted sleep deprivation methods during the siege to try and wear down the Davidians get them to come out. They blasted sounds throughout the night, including pop music, jet engines and the sound of rabbits being slaughtered.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d74d7218-8e6d-5db5-9c8c-9447140a5f61 data-container-ref=toofab:article:86933620-8a33-509b-bb7f-433173fbf9e3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/af/5by4/2018/01/21/af3203cb5ccd56a592f80ecd03cf7f24_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Scarlett Johansson Jabs James Franco at Women's March and 5 More Stars Speaking Out About Sexual Assault, Trump</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Who Started the Fires?</h2><p>Three fires erupted in the compound on Apr. 19 as the FBI was trying to use tear gas to end the siege. The combination of destruction in the compound and the gas in the air resulted in very few Davidians making it out of the compound. Over 70 people people died, including women, children and Koresh, who was found with a bullet in his forehead. The Justice Department in 2000 declared the Davidians started the fire, but other reports suggest they could have erupted accidentally in response to the FBI's gas assault.</p><h2 class=h2>Right Front Door</h2><p>The right front door of Mount Carmel Center was never recovered after the fire, though the steel door should have sustained no more damage than the left door. During the siege, Davidians spoke to the media and said that the right door proved that the government had shot first, as the bullet holes in it were all incoming. A reporter who visited the compound before the fires corroborated this story. The left door had gunfire holes going in both directions.</p><h2 class=h2>Waco Legacy</h2><p>After the disastrous outcome of the Waco raid and subsequent siege, ATF established new rules about how to handle these types of situations, and set the use of force as a last resort. A full write-up on the Waco incident became required reading for new recruits. Eight of the Waco survivors were sent to prison on firearms charges, but several appealed their cases all the way to the Supreme Court. The harshness of their 40-year sentences were reduced. As of 2007, all survivors were out of prison.</p><p>Paramount Network's six-part "Waco" is based on two nonfiction books about the siege, one from a Davidian survivor and the other from the FBI's Head of Crisis Negotiation. Michael Shannon, Taylor Kitsch, Andrea Riseborough, John Leguizamo, Melissa Benoist, Paul Sparks, Shea Whigham, Rory Culkin, Julia Garner and Camryn Manheim star in the six-part series.</p><a id=gallery-link-cc3ca991-87ce-55b6-b6c3-58c3ccaea489 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:cc3ca991-87ce-55b6-b6c3-58c3ccaea489 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20180123_6653932fc40c5ea3bca66d645ff501b2 data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:86933620-8a33-509b-bb7f-433173fbf9e3 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/66/4by3/2018/01/23/6653932fc40c5ea3bca66d645ff501b2_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j2pma2xfZoFuu8Vmq6GdXaK8tMCMm6CzmaKnsm6tzZ1krKCfmLiqusalsGasoqqybsDHoqWgq12uvLZ5zJqwZqafqXqzscyepJudomKuo7vUrWStoJVixKKvzmarq5mXmrG6ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./avoid-processed-foods-be-moment-marathon-runner-93-shares-10-tips-living-long-fit-and-healthy-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Avoid processed foods, be in the moment: marathon runner, 93, shares 10 tips for living a long, fit</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-did-ralph-macchio-do-in-between-the-karate-kid-part-iii-and-cobra-kai-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Did Ralph Macchio Do in Between 'The Karate Kid Part III' and 'Cobra Kai?'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
