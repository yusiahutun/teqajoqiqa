I know it is unpalatable but it is something I would say.</p><p>“Anyway, I’ve had some issues with my wife about hanging this neon sign in the house The missus ain’t having it. It is in the office at the mo."</p><p>It wasn't all potty-mouthed parting gifts though as he said goodbye to the Square after nine years.</p><p>Danny admits there was genuine emotion as he blubbed like a softie while saying farewells to his fellow cast at a leaving bash.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Soaps</h2></p><p>The party was organised by close pal <a href=#>Kellie Bright</a>, who played his screen wife Linda.</p><p>Danny said: “A part of me just wanted to duck out because it was emotional for me. I did a little speech. There were a lot of tears and there was a trailer of the best bits.</p><p>“It would have been easier to go out the back door. But Kellie organised something proper and I’m glad we did it."</p><p>The storyline around how Mick will leave the show remains under wraps but fans will see his <a href=#>scheming new bride Janine exposed.</a></p><p>As viewers know, she was responsible for the car crash that Linda believes was her fault.</p><p>And dramatic scenes on Christmas Day will see the fallout of Janine being unmasked having shocking consequences that will reverberate around Walford.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/22-12-2022-781094044-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpgbYFyg5BrZp2ZnqPGbrDYnqlmnZGowaa6w56prGWVrba1ecaina1lp56zpns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./659b1ef9ca474143038b4579-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eliminado de Exatln Mxico hoy: quin sale el domingo 7 de enero 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./caroline-wozniacki-david-lee-pool-time-in-italy.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Caroline Wozniacki and David Lee Hit the Pool in Italy</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
