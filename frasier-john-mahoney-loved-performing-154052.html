He emigrated to America and joined the US Army, becoming a citizen in 1959.</p><p>He later worked as an English teacher and medical-journal editor and didn’t start acting until he was 37. “I learned by doing it,” he said, spending years at Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre before getting his break in 1987’s Tin Men. Scene-stealing roles in Moonstruck and Say Anything followed. Then came Martin Crane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/frasier-6.jpg><p>The cast of Frasier.</p><p>“Frasier was a classy gig,” said John, who earned two Emmy nods for his expert turn as Martin, who loved his dog, Eddie, almost as much as his snooty sons, played by <a href=#>Kelsey Grammer</a> and David Hyde Pierce. John said, “I didn’t think for one minute it was less prestigious or artistic than doing a play.” That sense of professionalism shone through in all of John’s performances.</p><p>“He found great joy in the craft,” says Wendie, who also co-starred with him in The American President and Hot in Cleveland. Ironically, John excelled at playing fathers, even though he had no kids. “He was married to his work,” says Wendie. Say Anything co-star <a href=#>John Cusack</a> admits, “He always said it took him a long time to find out what he loved — and he loved performing. He was so happy to be there.”</p><p>For more on John Mahoney, pick up the latest issue of <i>Closer Weekly</i>, on newsstands now — and be sure to <a href=#>sign up for our newsletter</a> for more exclusive news!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46fqZqrmZq%2FbrbOoaVmpZGdvK%2Bx2GajqK6VmXqxsdGfpqulmaO0bn2UbWdual8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./princess-kate-middleton-ribbed-cream-sweater-midi-skirt.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Middleton Is Chic in a Ribbed Sweater and Matching Skirt</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./filipino-women-and-their-palestinian-spouses-find-hope-metro-manilas-little-gaza.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Filipino women and their Palestinian spouses find hope in Metro Manilas Little Gaza</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
