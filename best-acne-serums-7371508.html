With so many factors at play — what’s the root cause? What type of breakouts are you dealing with? — and so many different types of skincare products to treat this wide range of blemishes, it can be challenging to figure out the best course of action. Yet, the solution is strikingly simple: Serums.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Acne serums are loaded with concentrated levels of active ingredients to help you eradicate pimples and congestion of all kinds, from hormonal breakouts to painful nodules to pesky whiteheads, and the equally frustrating side effects they leave behind, like scarring and hyperpigmentation.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-skinbetter-science-alpharet-clearing-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SkinBetter Science AlphaRet Clearing Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SkinBetter Science AlphaRet Clearing Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/H_pQ0BYKWxbW2NSpCvkuMb7TczE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skinbetter-alpharet-clearing-serum-64fa3c77d6bf469e9aa2f64850cdcfc9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skin Better</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This derm-approved formula is loaded with multiple blemish fighters.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It absorbs into skin quickly, which is great, but also means it's easy to overdo it and apply more than you need.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love that SkinBetter Science formulas are clinically tested by dermatologists — and in the case of this well-rounded acne serum, used by them, too. “I personally use this product when needed,” says Alabama-based board certified dermatologist Dr. Corey L. Hartman.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It features both <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>BHA salicylic acid</a> and retinol to decongest pores, improve oil flow, promote cellular turnover, and clarify the complexion. “I love that it has two powerhouse ingredients in the retinol and salicylic acid, but it won’t dry out the skin,” Dr. Hartman adds.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But that’s not all: AlphaRet Clearing Serum also tapped lactic acid, a powerful AHA, along with anti-inflammatories (and oil tamers!) niacinamide and zinc, hydrating hyaluronic acid, and many plant extracts to soothe, calm, and nourish skin. It’s a truly efficacious product and a must for those looking to treat blemish-prone skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Salicylic acid, retinol, zinc｜<strong>Size:</strong> 1 fl oz｜<strong>Best for: </strong>Skin clarity, reducing pore size and improving texture</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-the-ordinary-niacinamide-10--zinc-1-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Oil Control Serum " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YzGTPikjQn9Rc4FaZUBQcRBEb6c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-ordinary-niacinamide-10---zinc-1-oil-control-serum-8869d212452f4612a10a83d8cf8390d3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has a pared-down ingredient list with a concentration of hardworking ingredients.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This may not treat more advanced breakouts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re dealing with skin inflammation and oily skin that causes breakouts, this affordable formula is a wonderful place to start. “This a great choice for first-time niacinamide users —&nbsp;it’s a fantastic price point and niacinamide will help reduce oil production and smooth the skin,” says Dr. Hartman, who notes that zinc is another sebum-balancing ingredient.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Niacinamide and zinc are both skin soothers, so red, tender breakouts may also find relief from this serum. However, if you need a treatment that will help resurface your skin to boost its clarity, this won’t do that for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Niacinamide, zinc｜<strong>Size:</strong> 1 fl. oz.｜<strong>Best for: </strong>Clearing blackheads and improving uneven texture and redness</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-dr-barbara-sturm-clarifying-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Barbara Sturm Clarifying Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Barbara Sturm Clarifying Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0IVmWVmYx881s6nozlkWbetFl0U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-barbara-sturm-clarifying-serum-cc4e1bcdd24045479b985f9591e56387.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dr. Barbara Sturm</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This formula is gentle enough to treat even the most sensitive acne-prone skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> For the price, it doesn’t contain many actives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beloved luxury skincare brand, Dr. Barbara Sturm, is known for its clean, solution-oriented formulas that treat skin without harsh ingredients, making them usable by anyone and everyone ready to invest in them. Dr. Sturm also follows the EU standards for product development, which are rigorous and don’t allow for the inclusion of over 1,000 ingredients that US brands are free to use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Case in point: This skin-clearing serum. It’s safe to be used by anyone over 15 and is so gentle that those with ultra-sensitive skin (even those with rosacea) can use it comfortably. Its power comes from plant extracts like purslane and albatrellus ovinus, a fungus with soothing properties, as well as calming zinc and moisturizing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hyaluronic acid</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fans of this product swear by it for its ability to clear up breakouts, fade acne scars, and brighten away discoloration —&nbsp;even melasma. It’s a great option for those who want something very gentle or who have reactive skin that can’t tolerate more aggressive formulations. However, if you’re looking for something super potent that’s loaded with active ingredients known for treating acne, you may not be satisfied by this product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Purslane extract, zinc, hyaluronic extract｜<strong>Size:</strong> 1 fl oz｜<strong>Best for: </strong>Clearing breakouts and calming redness</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-vitamin-c-skinceuticals-phloretin-cf-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Vitamin C</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SkinCeuticals Phloretin CF Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SkinCeuticals Phloretin CF Gel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/b078hlYlRkMmbl1DL0MX50m5T-c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skinceuticals-phloretin-cf-gel-011b9cc7844c4224a07257f12ffb2724.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bluemercury</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This formula maintains and improves skin clarity while defending skin from free radicals.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Like most SkinCeuticals products, the price is on the steep side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All dermatologists can agree that daily application of an antioxidant serum —&nbsp;especially a vitamin C formula —&nbsp;is a must for healthy and happy skin. “Phloretin CF Gel is a vitamin C that should be used first thing in the morning,” says Dr. Amanda Doyle, a board certified dermatologist in New York City. “This helps to reduce oxidative damage to the skin, which can contribute to acne.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While many <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vitamin C serums</a> can potentially irritate sensitive, acneic skin, this one was developed to be effective, yet still neutral enough to use daily. When applied as a topical, vitamin C speeds up cell turnover and boosts collagen production within the skin, to reveal brighter, more even skin, faster. Those who have acne scarring or post-pimple discoloration will benefit the most by using this powerful vitamin C serum daily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Phloretin, vitamin C, ferulic acid｜<strong>Size:</strong> 1 fl oz｜<strong>Best for: </strong>Discoloration and scars</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acne-scars-rene-rouleau-post-breakout-fading-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Acne Scars</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Renée Rouleau Fading Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ren&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;e Rouleau Post-Breakout Fading Gel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/f-5deYOu_DpWhAxR7w-2Wtn4csg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rene-rouleau-post-breakout-fading-gel-c52da25526314a039908bf795a128e31.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>RenÃ©e Rouleau</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This product is a lifesaver for those with dark post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation caused by cystic acne.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You only get half an ounce of product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Acne, especially inflammatory acne in the form of cysts, cause trauma to the skin, even after the blemish has disappeared. Cysts often leave behind dark spots that take their good old time to clear up, sometimes even weeks or months. Kicking these spots to the curb quickly was the hope behind this treatment gel from celebrity esthetician, Renée Rouleau.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This serum uses a blend of exfoliating acids (lactic and glycolic, to be specific) to

The most recognizable types of blemishes are visibly congested pores known as whiteheads and blackheads, which look exactly like their names. They form when sebum blocks the pore, inhibiting its ability to flow through smoothly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The other forms of blemishes are less well-known by their formal names. The first category are papules, which look like skin-colored or red bumps. “The cause is a blocked pore, but they occur when the pore is stretched too thin and ruptures, spreading dirt, oil, and debris into the surrounding skin,” explains Dr. Hartman. This triggers your body’s inflammatory response, leaving the skin tender and painful. You’ll typically find them on the face and neck, though they can form anywhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pustules are another form of blemish caused by inflammation, but look more intense —&nbsp;they’re what you’d recognize as a traditional zit. “These pimples develop when a collection of ‘pus’ or a thick and opaque, usually yellowish-white fluid matter forms in association with an acne lesion,” says Dr. Doyle. In addition to the face and neck, you might find these on other areas of the body, such as the neck and back — in which case a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>back acne treatment</a> would be appropriate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Then, there’s what is considered severe acne —&nbsp;both nodules and cysts. These blemishes lie deep under the skin, feel painful and look like a hard bump. “Acne nodules are often caused by a surge in androgen hormones, as well as an overabundance of sebum production,” explains Dr. Hartman. “I see nodular acne more often in young male patients and in adult female patients.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Doyle, cysts have a bit more substance. “They often develop a ‘wall’ or lining around the dead skin cells, oil and inflammation,” she says. “They can be recurrent given that they often refill with material over time.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When treating these different forms of acne, you want to look for a serum with active ingredients that target their unique causes. For example, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>products to combat blackheads</a> will not be effective on a cyst.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Active Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the heaviest-hitting ingredient classes across the skincare spectrum is retinoids, which are vitamin A derivatives. “My opinion is that, with the exception of people with rosacea or overly sensitive skin, everyone should be using a retinol,” says Dr. Hartman, who says applying a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>retinol product</a> is the most important step to add to your routine to promote skin health after SPF. “Retinols regulate cell turnover, promote effective exfoliation, prevent acne, even discoloration, control oil, smooth fine lines and wrinkles, unclog pores, and so much more.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another common ingredient you’ll see listed on the boxes of acne serums is salicylic acid, also known as a beta-hydroxy acid or BHA, which can also be found in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>foundations for acne-prone skin</a>. This exfoliating ingredient is oil-soluble, which means it can go deep within the pore to break up the dead skin cells causing congestion. And though they look and sound similar, BHAs differ from alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs). AHAs, like glycolic and lactic acids, are water-soluble, which means they resurface the top layer of the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Benzoyl peroxide is another key player in blemish serums. “Benzoyl peroxide is an anti-inflammatory that works to treat mild to moderate acne by killing the bacteria that causes acne,” explains Dr. Hartman. “It also helps to prevent acne by exfoliating the skin and can help minimize redness and the inflammation from cystic acne.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though these are the main ingredients you’ll see in acne serums, there are plenty of others that are used to balance or neutralize a strong formula in order to make it wearable and comfortable, including the anti-inflammatory niacinamide and zinc or plant-based alternatives, like bakuchiol and willow bark.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Non-Comedogenic Formulas</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fun fact: “Comedo” is the technical term for blackheads, one of the most familiar forms of pore congestion.

Benzoyl peroxide can also be great for inflamed, angry acne.&nbsp;However, if your acne isn't chronic or they appear as small whiteheads and blackheads, AHAs are a solid bet. They’ll slough away the surface layer of skin, which can block the pore, inhibiting the flow of oil, while offering the added bonus of drying out little pimples to push them to heal faster.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are serums good for acne?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Serums are targeted treatments with high percentages of active ingredients, so they can be stellar solutions for acne —&nbsp;but not all serums are the same, and what works for one person may not work for another.&nbsp;“Whether or not acne-prone skin benefits from a serum has more to do with the individual’s skin health,” says Dr. Madhère.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your acne is more severe and manifests as nodules or cysts, a serum bought over the counter may not work for you. “Often, a prescription paired with in-office treatments are needed to clear the skin,” says Dr. Hartman.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your blemishes aren’t responding to what you’ve bought from your favorite beauty retailer, book an appointment with a board certified dermatologist for a proper medical evaluation about what’s going on with your skin and how to heal it.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How often should you apply acne serums?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The answer to this question depends on your skin and the formula you’ve chosen, as well as the season and your geographical climate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Most people can tolerate using a serum to treat acne three to four times per week,” says Dr. Hartman, who recommends building up from a once- or twice-weekly application.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have sensitive skin, remember that some ingredients, like acids and retinoids, can cause irritation, so don’t overdo it.
