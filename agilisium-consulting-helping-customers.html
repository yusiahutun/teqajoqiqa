And, about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are being generated every day. Therefore, it has become very important to analyze the growing data. And big data analytics are very important because it helps in making smart decisions, it provides hidden patterns, correlations, and other insights.</p><p>With today’s technology, it is possible to analyze every piece of data and get an answer almost immediately. Big data analytics helps in gaining insights and making strategic decisions.</p><p>After the situation like a roller-coaster ride in 2020, businesses are striving hard to be relevant in the market. And to do so there is the only way, adopting ‘Technology’. To cater to the data needs of businesses, Agilisium Consulting offers cutting-edge and advanced big data and analytics solutions.</p><p>Under the 360 degrees futuristic vision of Mr. Raj Babu, CEO, the <a href=# rel=noopener>team Agilisium Consulting</a> is transmogrifying businesses with the top notched offering. In a conversation with Mr. Raj Babu, we discussed the current industry scenario and how Agilisium Consulting is transforming businesses.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brief us about Agilisium Consulting.</h2><p>Agilisium Consulting is a <a href=#>Big Data and Analytics company</a> with a clear focus on helping organizations take the “Data-to-Insights-Leap.” To that end, Agilisium Consulting has invested in all stages of the data journey: Data Architecture Consulting, Data Integration, Data Storage, Data Governance, and Data Analytics. Our talent pool comprises 70+ certified experts in AWS & GCP Data Analytics services, and we have successfully migrated 15+ PB workloads onto the cloud.</p><p>We are an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner with Redshift, EMR, DevOps & QuickSight competencies.

Be it Media and Entertainment, Lifesciences, High Tech, or Retail; our experts have wide-ranging yet in-depth domain experience and have delivered transformative, purpose-made data analytics solutions, both simple and complex.</p><p>In addition to data strategy and consulting, big data analytics, and managed services, our crack team of innovators work with cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to build solutions to the unique problems facing enterprises in the age of big data.</p><p>Nothing worthwhile is ever achieved without deep thought and hard work.</p>JRD Tata<p>With advanced Design Thinking capabilities, a thriving Partner Ecosystem, and top-notch industry certiﬁcations, Agilisium Consulting is inherently vested in our clients’ success.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What were the initial challenges you faced?&nbsp;</h3><p>Our initial challenges were to distinguish ourselves from the competition and define a value proposition. We also must ensure our solutions help businesses to take the data to insight leap. So, it is our commitment to staying relevant to every business we associate with and resonate with their goals.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Which was that point that triggered the growth of Agilisium Consulting?</h3><p>Just like us (human beings), every business is unique. At Agilisium Consulting, we believe the very existence of the concept “one size fits all” is invalid. Therefore, we didn’t only deliver solutions but also went a step ahead and added a human touch by listening to our clients, staying relevant to their needs, and delivering tailor-made solutions. Also, the partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) was one of the most critical decisions that took Agilisium Consulting to the next level. Since then, our partnership has been the North Star of Agilisium Consulting.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How have Agilisium Consulting graphs changed since the foundation? Can you share a few statistics?</h3><p>Founded in 2014, we have grown at an average rate of 70% YoY in both revenue and headcounts</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What is the reason behind Agilisium Consulting’s long-standing success?</h3><p>There are two reasons behind our long-standing success:</p><li>Empathy towards the customers and being obsessed with their success.</li><li>AWS partnership focus and obsession.</li><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are the products/services Agilisium Consulting focuses on? How are your services different from those in the market?</h3><p>We currently focus on Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, and AWS Partnership. The transparency we maintain with our clients has allowed us to stay relevant and be obsessed with their success. Because each one of our solutions is tailored to meet the end needs of the client.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How do you decide to take Agilisium Consulting a step further in terms of your products/services?</h3><p>Our short-term goal is to establish ourselves as a data analytics solution provider. In the long run, we would like to establish ourselves as a solution and product company.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>According to you, how has the Covid-19 changed the ways of business processes, and how one should adopt these changes?</h3><p>Simply put, “Remote workforce is the global workforce.” COVID-19 is a box of diamonds for us as it has opened more opportunities for remote working. Also, it is a paradigm shift for the businesses that are embracing remote work themselves, and automation is quintessential. When you have devised a well-thought-out structure, discipline, tools, and a process plan, you have a framework that ensures all your operations are efficiency-driven.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Can you please brief us about your professional experience?</h3><p>I’m passionate about customer success and has solid experience in customer-facing business such as Media, Retail, Consumer Goods & Electronics for the last 20+ years. My area of interest & expertise includes Digital Business, BI, Big Data, and Consumer Analytics. I’m a straight shooter and popular among customers for my honest feedback on technology adoption and outcomes.</p><p>Though we’re into Data Analytics and Cloud, we’re an IT services firm at core.</p>Agilisium Consulting<h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are the key achievements of your entrepreneurial journey?</h3><p>Learning is something that keeps you alive. The mode of learning differs from person to person. While I was an employee, I learned how to execute a time-stipulated task efficiently. When I took a turn and became an entrepreneur, I had to get my hands dirty on various departments to take my next steps meticulously. So, learning is one big achievement. Apart from that, my entrepreneurial journey has introduced me to many people who have entrepreneurial drives. Also, the vision of Agilisium Consulting is broad, and to achieve it, you need a support system. I call them family, and it is nurtured by a group of like-minded individuals who help us get a step closer to our vision.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How do you look after your employees? What makes your team unique?</h3><p>I would like to start with your second question first. I believe that the character is destiny. Therefore, at Agilisium Consulting, we demand employees be brutally honest with our clientele and never compromise on character and values. The employees can be trained for skills, but not for character. So, we continuously indulge in enhancing their skills through training and ensure they’re a step ahead in their career.</p><p>Similarly, we cultivate social responsibility. As humans, we’re operating in an ecosystem and not in a vacuum. The ecosystem is the very reason for our existence. Hence, we encourage our teams to be socially responsible.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Is there any special experience with your clients you would like to highlight?</h3><p>Though we’re into Data Analytics and Cloud, we’re an IT services firm at core. One of our clients witnessed our commitment and obsession towards customer success and decided to continue our relationship beyond the scope of our expertise. In other words, the client’s initial requirement was to help them with the Data Analytics part, and they continued to take our relationship beyond the horizon to develop a product. We took up the challenge, which is not our sweet spot, and delivered the project successfully because of the trust they vested in us.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Please share your thoughts on what businesses should do to be relevant in the market race after the COVID19 outbreak.</h3><li>Identify your USPs</li><li>Make your customers feel important</li><li>Make your customers understand the importance of your solutions to their business</li><li>Communicate your USPs to your audience effectively</li><li>Deliver tailored solutions to your customers’ business needs</li><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Whose business story do you find the most inspiring?</h3><li>Zoho – To establish as a product company across the world from India</li><li>Carnegie – Philanthropy</li><li>Elon Musk’s tenacious risk-taking and innovation</li><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Constant vigilance – a need or a strategy? Please share your views.</h3><p>Any species on the face of the earth needs to evolve themselves to stay relevant to the time they’re living in. That’s how we humans also fit in society. Likewise, it is applicable for businesses too. Ultimately, businesses exist to solve people’s problems. Therefore, businesses must go through continuous evolution to stay relevant and satisfy their customer needs. So, constant vigilance for staying relevant is a need for sure.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It’s a rat race out there. How do you cope with that?</h3><p>It’s good to be in a rat race if it is healthy. The very reason for businesses to exist is to address and serve the customers better. When there is healthy competition, the beneficiary is the customer. To cope with the competition, your business needs to find a niche, identify the pain points, and address them with your solution. Simply put, narrow down your customers and offer highly focused solutions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZK6otcuiqqKtnWKwsLrSrqOtoZ6ceqmxy6mgp59dmMK0wM6mnKur</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cara-delevingne-opens-up-about-rehab-addiction.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cara Delevingne Entered Rehab After Heartbreaking Photos Gave Her Addiction Reality Check</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-celebrity-halloween-decorations-of-2023-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Celebrity Halloween Decorations of 2023: Photos of Your Favorite Stars Fall Displays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
