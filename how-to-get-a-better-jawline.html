Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Dr. Sameer Bashey</a> credits our new digital lifestyle, and by extension, the unavoidable full-screen views of our neck and faces, with a renewed focus on jaw treatments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"People are more conscious now of their facial anatomy because they are seeing themselves on camera ... a lot more," he explains. A majority of these patients all ask for the same thing: a sharper jawline, he adds. So if you're looking to tone and tighten this body part, we've got you covered. From at-home, non-invasive treatments to professional in-office procedures, we tapped a slew of experts for the best options available when it comes to sculpting your jawline.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-at-home-tools></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>At-Home Tools</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Facial Massager</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If a tool is more your style, celebrity facialist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Joanna Czech</a>, renowned for her crazy-effective and impossibly slimming massages, developed an at-home <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>facial sculpting massager</a> to do all the heavy lifting for you and it couldn't be easier to use. Simply roll it from the center of the chin to your earlobe. And real talk: a facial massage works wonders for a puffy-face hangover or salty late-night feast.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Toning Device</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another option — and one of the most popular at-home tech tools — is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>NuFACE Facial Toning Device</a>. It works to stimulate your face, jaw, and neck by using microcurrent technology to improve the jawline contour and tighten skin tone and fine lines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pro tip: According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Raquel Medina-Cleghorn</a>, lead esthetician at Joanna Czech, most people apply serums and moisturizers incorrectly — tugging the skin downward, jaw to collarbone — which can accelerate creasing of the skin. But what they really should be doing is applying products in an upward sweeping motion, collarbone to jaw. To really amp up the results, give yourself a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>lymphatic drainage massage</a> — kneading and pinching the jawline upward toward your ear — as you apply your serum.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>At-Home Radio Frequency</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Celebrity esthetician Joshua Ross of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>SkinLab</a> adds that the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Trilogy Wand</a> is a great choice, as well. '[It] mimics a radio frequency treatment in the office where the heat creates growth factors to help firm the skin — minimally invasive professional treatments in the office would be a radio frequency treatment," he explains. "This works to sculpt the jaw by heating the tissue, causing the skin to create growth factors to produce new collagen and elastin which will help support and tighten the skin around the jawline." Just keep in mind that generally speaking, at-home tools are best used at a younger age, notes Ross. When the skin begins to mature, professional treatments tend to be more effective.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-in-office-treatments></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>In-Office Treatments</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Filler</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Restylane Defyne and Juvéderm Voluma XC are two popular FDA-approval dermal fillers that treat the chin. "Most [patients] will have some sort of bony deficiency of the chin and jawline that can easily be corrected with filler," says Dr. Bashey. To sculpt and define — versus the traditional plumping fillers that temporarily fill in sunken areas — he favors biostimulatory injectors, like Sculptura or hyper-diluted Radiesse, to stimulate the body's own collagen and build volume over time, adding projection to the chin and tightening the tissue along the anterior jawline.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sculptura, in particular, is the most long-lasting injectable, with clinical trials showing a two-year lifespan. Although it can be used elsewhere on the body, it does its best, most effective work along the jawline to resolve moderate skin laxity.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Kybella</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For jawlines that can have the appearance of a double chin, a popular non-invasive option is Kybella, an injectable specifically developed to dissolve fat cells underneath the chin and slim the jawline profile. "Kybella is an alternative to superficial liposuction and only addresses superficial fat," explains New York City-based board-certified plastic surgeon <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Steven Levine</a>, who cautions that while a non-invasive procedure is appealing to many, there are cons to consider.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You never know how much of a reaction or result you're going to get with it because you're relying on the union of a drug and a person," he says. "Some people react wonderfully from it and get a great result and others won't." He adds that multiple injections are required, each with around 10 days of downtime, and reactions from each injection could vary.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Radio Frequency Treatments</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"These work by heating the tissue from 39 to 41 degrees Celsius," Ross explains. "This will activate all of the growth factors and send them to the area being heated, resulting in more collagen and elastin, which will firm and tighten the skin. In my office, we use Venus Legacy for this treatment."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ross recommends a plan of once a week for six weeks, and then six times a year afterward to maintain results. There's also generally no downtime. "These tightening treatments are considered a lifestyle treatment, so they're not permanent and you will continue to age," he shares. "They can range from $300 to $500 per treatment, but it's always a good idea to ask your provider if they can offer a package discount for purchasing multiple sessions at once."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-surgical-procedures></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Surgical Procedures</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Chin Implants</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not widely known as a solution for a lackluster jaw, yet for the right candidate, a chin implant can help to sculpt the jawline. "If someone doesn't have a significantly projected chin, a small chin implant has a very, very powerful effect on the upper neck skin because you're using an implant to tighten the skin of the neck up by pulling that neck skin forward, while at the same time addressing some of the excess fat underneath," explains Manhattan-based board-certified plastic surgeon <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Adam Kolker</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"By changing the architecture of the neck, you're also [changing] the appearance of the jawline, right below the jawline and the upper neck for a slimmer, more contoured look."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: How to Do a Subtle Contour</strong></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Liposuction</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The surgical sister to the non-invasive Kybella is liposuction — but it's not your mother's, or maybe even your babysitter's, liposuction. Leaps in recent technology have allowed for the formerly intensive surgery to evolve into a more precise procedure, with a shorter surgery time and recovery. According to Levine, the ideal candidate is usually 50 years old or younger.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The limitation of liposuction is how elastic someone's skin is because the best result relies on skin contraction," explains Levine. "When you remove volume from the neck in a patient that has good elasticity, you actually get the jaw to look more contoured, and that can happen with superficial liposuction, which is the more traditional liposuction, or with deep neck contouring, where you're removing deep fat to improve the upper neck and chin. And both of these types of lipo are less invasive than a traditional neck lift."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Jawline, Neck, or Facelift</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a patient with a fair amount of skin or neck excess, jowling and settling at the jawline and beneath the chin, the only valuable option is limited to a surgical solution. "As we age, our youthful, heart-shaped face and neck from the hairline down to the collarbones, becomes a trapezoid where the upper face loses volume, the lower face gains volume and becomes wider, making the jawline wider, and things tend to settle in the jawline region," Dr. Kolker says of our facial evolution.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Patients wanting to restore that heart shape of youth and to really see a significant improvement in the neck area, are likely to be a candidate for a jawline, neck, or facelift, which is to take that jawline, clean it up, bring the soft tissues that descended into the jawline and put them back where they came from."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-final-takeaway></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Final Takeaway</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Surgical procedures sit squarely at the top of the aesthetics hierarchy in terms of risks, cost, and commitment to overall recovery. Yet they are the golden standard for serious, durable results compared to nonsurgical alternatives that carrier fewer risks, but offer less pronounced short-term results. What's right for you is all a matter of your own personal aesthetic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1on6ivXam8brPErWSaZZKawbWx0Wahmq%2Bcnrum</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./audrey-tautou-secretly-married-husband-drops-perspective-dating-types-men-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Audrey Tautou Secretly Married With Husband?
