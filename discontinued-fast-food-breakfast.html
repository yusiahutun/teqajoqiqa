JACK IN THE BOX BREAKFAST WAFFLE SANDWICH</h2><p>In 2003, waffle eaters finally got a sandwich of their own as McDonald's introduced its McGriddle.</p><p>But Jack in the Box lovers rejoiced when the fast food joint offered its take on the savory and sweet sandwich, the Breakfast Waffle Sandwich.</p><p>The item featured sausage, eggs, and cheese all sandwiched in between two waffles.</p><p>Launching in 2012, it never took off in the same way the McGriddle did and was quietly discontinued.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>However, some fans are still calling for its return.</p><p>One fan took to Twitter writing: “I would do anything, and I mean ANYTHING to have Jack In the Box bring back the waffle breakfast sandwich. They removed it from the breakfast menu in 2014 and my life hasn’t been the same since.”</p><h2>2. MCDONALD’S PARFAIT</h2><p>The <a href=#>Fruit 'n Yogurt Parfait</a> was available for decades and marketed as a healthier alternative to the standard greasy menu items most McDonald's love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/nk_CE7JR7_FruitParfaitMcDonaldsjpg-JS806878078.jpg><p>Popular Twitter account Discontinued Foods! revealed that the item was available from 1999 to 2020.</p><p>Served all day, the parfait came with low-fat yogurt, sliced strawberries and blueberries, and crunchy granola.</p><p>The Twitter account also mentioned that the parfait was given the ax during the pandemic when <a href=#>fast food</a> joints were phasing out menu items where they could - however, The U.S. Sun could not confirm.</p><p>Initially offered on the McDonald's $1 menu, prices rose as high as $1.19 before being removed from menus, according to So Loyal.</p><h2>3. BURGER KING ENORMOUS OMELET SANDWICH</h2><p>The self-acclaimed king of burgers introduced its take on the breakfast sandwich back in 2005 with the Enormous Omelet Sandwich.</p><p>The sandwich definitely lived up to its name as fans got cheese, eggs, bacon, and sausage all on its famous long-shaped sesame bun.</p><p>While the discontinued timeframe is a bit sticky, customers first took notice in 2010 as it was gone for good.</p><h2>4. DONUT FRIES</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/msemail_LB-Screenshot_Capture_-_2023-04-21_-_11-29-47jpg-JS811623701.jpg><p>In 2018, Dunkin' launched Donut Fries, which featured individual pieces of buttery, croissant-style donut dough tossed in cinnamon sugar and served warm.</p><p>The company described this trend as, "Two words: Donut. Fries. You’re welcome, America."</p><p>Just in time for the Fourth of July, the item got into customers' hands, who were able to grab them at participating Dunkin’ Donuts across the country.</p><p>You could score five Donut Fries in each order for just $2 until sadly they were given the ax.</p><h2>5. STARBUCKS ALMOND CROISSANT</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/msemail_LB-Screenshot_Capture_-_2023-04-21_-_11-40-48jpg-JS811623703.jpg><p>This French-inspired breakfast treat was quietly discontinued within the past year and some change, The U.S. Sun confirmed.</p><p>While it's unclear why the croissant is gone for good, most items get the ax for a number of reasons - low sales being the most common.</p><p>This one hurt many fans as it was easy to grab and eat on the go.</p><p>Even Starbucks baristas were disappointed with the company as one posted a TikTok sharing: “A very quick PSA for those who do not know, yes Almond Croissants were discontinued and no it doesn’t make any sense why.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The U.S. Sun reveals the <a href=#>major change</a> that McDonald’s is making to a fan favorite.</p><p>Plus, sandwich shop <a href=#>Jimmy John's</a> has introduced a brand new, limited edition menu item.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbIZ0fJVybWicmaiwsLrToqWunZRis6K%2F02adqKeUYq%2BzscCknZqrpGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lady-gaga-leather-coat-platform-boots.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lady Gaga Looks Insanely Cool in a Floor-Sweeping Leather Coat</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brother-sister-die-car-crash-california-highway-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brother and sister die is car crash on California highway</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
