"Can you explain how it is that the royal standard got frostnip?" He later added, "Why did you not take care of the royal jewels? … The context of this is that you are going to the North Pole, and things got very cold. At what point did you realize there was a crisis at the South Pole?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"First of all, it didn't turn into an icicle," Harry jokingly clarified. "It's fine now, thank you. The context was that these amazing veterans were doing a walk to the North Pole. They had all the training, I had none. And I turned up thinking, How bad can this be? … It's only the North Pole, it's only minus 35 degrees. I've got the salopettes, I've got the jacket, I've got the warm stuff, I've got all the things that I need. What I didn't have was what I had when I actually went to the South Pole, which was a cock cushion."</p><img alt="the late show with stephen colbert and guest prince harry, the duke of sussex, during tuesday’s january 10, 2023 show photo scott kowalchykcbs ©2022 cbs broadcasting inc all rights reserved" title="the late show with stephen colbert and guest prince harry, the duke of sussex, during tuesday’s january 10, 2023 show photo scott kowalchykcbs ©2022 cbs broadcasting inc all rights reserved" width=3000 height=1996 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/119478-0312-1673456126.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Scott Kowalchyk/CBS</span><p>Prince Harry on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Spare</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$19 at Amazon for Spare" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593593804 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593593804 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593593804 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241365+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241381+00:00"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$19 at Amazon" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593593804 data-vars-ga-product-brand="Random House" data-vars-ga-product-id=6203eb6d-cefe-412f-b84f-e14bd4684606 data-vars-ga-product-price=$19.10 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=05517e53-bdc5-4a82-bc52-bd3e541c6231 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Random House" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | On Sale" data-vars-ga-sku=0593593804 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt=Spare title=Spare src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1666876518-41CSAHVHkL._SL500_.jpg width=329 height=500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Spare</h2></p><p>Now 47% Off</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At this unexpected answer, Colbert broke into laugher.

"A lovely lady who made a cushion for me having been told by the guide from the North Pole, 'He's doing this again, he's gonna need some extra protection.' Because the pants I was wearing … that's all I had. So my man piece, my Johnson, my Wilson, my todger, my willy, all the things and any other words … "</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The Tower of London," Colbert cheekily added.

It's just numb."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The royal said he didn't realize what damage had been done until weeks after he returned home.
