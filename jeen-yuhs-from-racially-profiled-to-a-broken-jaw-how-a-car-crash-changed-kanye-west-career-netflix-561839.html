In the early 2000s, West emerged on the hip-hop scene and worked behind the camera to help budding artists. But he was massively talented and everyone knew that one day he will be making a glorious career out of his talent. It was the year 2001 when Kanye was being recognized by big <a title=hip-hop href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hip-hop</a> artists and rappers, including <a title=Jay-Z href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z</a>, all around the music industry. However, producing was never his passion. Yes, he wanted to make tunes for big artists, but he wanted to be an artist as well.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a title="Kanye West's mental health: Inside billionaire rapper's 'sprained brain' and social media rants" href=# rel>Kanye West's mental health: Inside billionaire rapper's 'sprained brain' and social media rants</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a title="'Kanye West channeling OJ Simpson': Fans worry as rapper rants about Pete Davidson" href=# rel>'Kanye West channeling OJ Simpson': Fans worry as rapper rants about Pete Davidson</a></p><p>The <a title=rapper href=# rel>rapper</a> knew how important it was for him to work at that time and with that level of work, he was slowly inching toward something special. 2002 turned out to be a life-changing year for the ‘Stronger’ hitmaker. Not only did he begin working on his own material, but he also survived a major accident that could have ended his life.</p><p>So, what happened? And how did that accident change his life forever? Let’s dig a little deeper and know more about the matter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b5f07670-0739-4228-8650-a9d6e531a0ab.png><h2 class=split>Kanye’s blossoming career and a tragic accident</h2><p>When it comes to Kanye West’s career, he worked with one of the biggest rapper artists of all time, Jay-Z, in 2001 and produced key tracks for the album ‘The Blueprint’. West returned for its sequel as well and gave some really amazing tunes. His style of clothing and mannerisms always gave that gangsta-style vibe that had dominated the music industry for years.</p><p>It was Jay-Z who spotted this talent and gave him a contract under his record label Roc-A-Fella. However, Kanye didn’t know that something tragic is about to him.</p><p>In 2002, two weeks after signing the deal, the rapper was on-course to start his own work and as soon as he started working on it, he hit a roadblock. On October 23, 2002, the rapper was busy producing music for The Black Eyed Peas, Beanie Sigel, and Peedi Crakk. He was working in a studio in California. After a long day at work, the rapper left the studio at around 3 am in his rented Lexus and he was feeling so tired that he fell asleep at the wheel. He crashed his rented vehicle head-on into another car and was badly injured.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/61e0151e-156d-4166-8798-4c1f4bb66769.jpg><p>The next thing he knew that he was being taken to the hospital so that he could be treated. At the hospital, it was revealed that West suffered a major injury on his jaw and his jaw was busted. He also had nasal fractures that made it hard for him to breathe properly. At the time, MTV reported West was not in danger and has a fractured jaw. His jaw was wired shut for the next six weeks.</p><p>At the time, Kanye gave an interview to <a title=MTV href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MTV</a> and told them that the accident was really painful and his jaw was broken in three places. He also revealed that he was racially profiled as police ran three or four alcohol tests before taking him to the hospital.</p><p>“I was completely in pain and completely racially profiled and harassed. They did three or four tests on me for alcohol. After the first test [it should be clear] that I'm not drinking alcohol,” West said at the time.</p><p>According to the rapper, doctors had to wire his jaw shut, a procedure that he claimed was done twice because they did it wrong the first time.</p><h2 class=split>Determination to bounce back</h2><p>Two weeks after he was admitted to the hospital he was released and was itching to do some work. But he also knew that it was the only time when he could have the chance to make something for himself. The accident gave him a new perspective on life and soon realized that he wants to be a rapper, he needs to start working on it now.</p><p>So, West decided to return to the studio and made his first-ever single titled ‘Through the Wire’. People around him called him mad for it because he recorded the song with his jaw still wired shut, and when the official video of the song came out, he also included photos of himself with a swollen face. But his determination kept him going and he finally came out with the song in 2004.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/a517869c-a247-4266-a813-f03b1b05bb61.1236084544><p>Despite having so much pain, Kanye decided to work because he knew that it was the only time he could have done something for himself. The hard work paid off and the song turned out to be a massive hit for the rapper. The song received positive reviews and was certified Platinum and Gold in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively.</p><p>The track was also nominated for a 2005 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance, but lost to Jay-Z's ‘99 Problems’. It was just the beginning for West as he went on to become one of the most successful rappers in the music industry.</p><p>The upcoming Netflix documentary ‘Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy’ will be talking about such instances and his career in music with unseen archival footage from the past two decades.</p><p>‘Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy’ will be premiering exclusively on Netflix and will be coming out with ‘Act 1’ on Wednesday, February 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoopWau27F1KGqZp6ipLpuvsCcoJqknK56sb7On6ClnZRiwbB5wGaZq6ebmrtutsCwZKGnp2Kubq%2FAq2ScqpGotW6vx5qloJ2UYriiutieZLCdo6l6pK3RnpyrZZ6awae4yLFkbm5hbYB6</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./another-online-sex-drama-hits-hong-kong-its-not-r-rated.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Another online sex drama hits Hong Kong, but it's not R-rated</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./drake-milligan-injured-van-crash.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'America's Got Talent' Star Drake Milligan Injured in Van Crash</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
