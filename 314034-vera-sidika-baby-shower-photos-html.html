When it comes to flaunting assets, there is none like the Kenyan socialite. She was recently on a mission in Tanzania to show them what Kenya has to offer during the Tanasha Donna baby shower. So, given that it was Tanasha Donna’s baby shower, why is it that Vera Sidika is trending as a result of the same function? Vera Sidika baby shower photos will let you know.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs2ska27883ot.jpg><p class=align-left>Tanasha Donna has been in the headlines ever since she hooked up with Tanzanian singer Diamond. Many thought that it was just a fling that would die with time, but the relationship seems to be going strong with them welcoming their first child. The occasion was set for a baby shower in which one would have thought Tanasha would have been the talking point.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e5bb2d7be2a53bc8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Elani's Maureen Kunga wedding: New photos from the ceremony</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is Vera Sidika however who stole the show with her dressing at the event. According to many, Vera showed up nude, but then again, we live in an era where women are embracing the freedom to dress as they please. Below are some Vera Sidika baby shower photos you must see.</p><h2>1. It is always about her</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e5bb2d7be2a53bc8.jpg><p class=align-left>It was meant to be a day for Tanasha Donna and Diamond to celebrate their unborn baby, but Vera Sidika had to steal the show and ensure that she was in the headlines. She chose to wear a see-through jumpsuit that many have been quick to condemn. Her bottom was all bare for everyone to see, but the socialite was in the least disturbed about the predicament she had created. She seems to have enjoyed every moment during the event. It reminds us that Vera Sidika will go to any length to stand out.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ca8052a4fd6270c6.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lovely pictures of Tanasha Donna pregnancy</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Tanasha Donna baby shower: All the pictures and famous attendees</p><h2>2. Normal is boring</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1120d409c73740f6.jpg><p class=align-left>A wise woman once said normal is boring, that wise woman was Vera Sidika. She has repeatedly shown us that she does not conform to societal expectations, and it is not difficult to see why. She knew that she had to do something ‘unique’ to bring out some excitement at the baby shower. She went with the colour white as many other guests did, but she added a beach theme to her costume. She then shared a selfie of herself before heading to the baby shower.</p><h2>3. Assets and assets</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ca8052a4fd6270c6.png><p class=align-left>While many people will be curious regarding the type of car Vera is in, many others will shift their attention to how she is dressed. This shot attracts viewers more to her breasts as she has left her cleavage out for admirers. The photo must have given some men sleepless nights, but again it is Vera Sidika’s nature to tease men every opportunity she gets.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fc10daa8397114dc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vera Sidika flaunts her new boyfriend online</span></p></a><h2>4.

In this picture, Vera Sidika settled at the baby shower and decided to take some photos for her fans. Guys beside her could not resist the opportunity of a photo with the voluptuous beauty queen as they showed excitement at her sight.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Tanasha Donna: New photos from her pregnancy</p><h2>5.

However, when it comes to Queen Vee when she goes to Rome, she takes along whatever she can, including her looks. It is the attitude of a person ready to conquer the world. Despite being a guest at Tanasha’s baby shower, the Kenyan socialite could not keep a low profile but held her head high with a dress of a kind. Vera Sidika dressing style has been the major talking point several days after the event.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c7ade0983f4a87ce.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 hottest photos of Idris Elba's wife Sabrina Dhowre</span></p></a><h2>6. At the end of the day, it is happiness that matters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fc10daa8397114dc.jpg><p class=align-left>The good thing with people like Vera Sidika is that they do not do things to please other people. They think about themselves first and what makes them happy. The smile on her face says it all. The socialite could not be more pleased than she was at this moment. She is also an inspiration to many people who are amazed by her positive attitude in life. So whether you like or hate Vera Sidika’s dress that is on you. According to her, she is living her best life and so should you.</p><h2>7. Support to a friend</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/22709e545794fbf9.jpg><p class=align-left>It should be remembered that Tanasha Donna’s baby shower was an invite-only function, and thus, Vera was there as a friend to the Kenyan radio presenter. Vera was graceful enough to travel to Tanzania for the function. She said the two have been friends for a while and she wished her all the best as she becomes a mother. It is good to know that despite her busy and controversial life, Vera can find the time to be with her friends when they need her. Despite the controversial dress, Diamond and Tanasha Donna must have appreciated her support.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/65b60d7c374b4973.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest Vera Sidika photos - Has she bleached again?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Vera Sidika is a social media influencer, and so she does not let any opportunity to expand her brand pass by. She has to capitalize on every opportunity to ensure that she stays clear ahead of the rest. She clearly understands the dynamics of brand marketing because they say that there is no such thing as bad publicity. Publicity is publicity. Drifting from the idea of brand and marketing, the choice of dressing at this age and time is informed by how comfortable an individual feels in particular clothes. Vera Sidika baby shower photos are just a tip of the iceberg of what to expect from the Kenyan socialite.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Latest celebrity news: Tanasha Donna's baby shower, Vera Sidika's raunchy dressing, Willy Paul & more</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkG1nbGxdq7KzrYysoJ2hm5Z6o63BsmSsoJ%2BssrN5z6GmraejY7W1ucs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-zedra.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Zedra</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-10-best-jailbreak-films.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 best jailbreak films | Culture</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
