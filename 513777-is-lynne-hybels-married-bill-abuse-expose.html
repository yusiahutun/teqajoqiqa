The allegations spanned several decades, including a prolonged affair with a married woman.</p><p class=align-left>The allegations only came out in 2018, but investigations had started earlier. When the reports came out, the church reviewed the behaviour portrayed by Bill Hybels. The internal review did not discover any findings of misconduct. Also, Bill Hybels denied the accusations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a497e095dff70329.jpg><p class=align-left>A second review by an independent review of Christian leaders found the allegations against Bill Hybels true. As a result, he stepped down from his role with the Willow Creek Community Church. He also ceased to be a board member of the Willow Creek Association.</p><p class=align-left>After the revelations, attendance at Willow Creek Community Church plummeted. In 2015, the Church received over 25,000 attendees. But after the allegations, the <a href=#>church attendance</a> number was reduced to around 18,000.

Her response came privately in 2017 through Lynne's letter to Leanne Mellado, the married woman at the centre of the affair.</p><p class=align-left>Since the revelations came out in 2018, Lynne has never commented on the allegations but has <a href=#>supported the victims</a> and shared her faith and passion for justice online.</p><h2>Where is Bill Hybels today?</h2><p class=align-left>Bill Hybels has made his life private since he resigned from Willow Creek Church.
