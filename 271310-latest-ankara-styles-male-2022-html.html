One thing that makes the Ankara fabric a standout is the intensity of its prints; it doesn't fade like the typical printed textiles.</p><h2>Latest Ankara styles for men</h2><p class=align-left>Are you looking for the best Ankara styles for men that'll make your wardrobe appear exquisite? <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to Ankara</a>, these are the latest Ankara styles for men that are perfect for almost all occasions or events.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e5612769bec26fd5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 latest Ankara styles for teenagers that are fashionable now</span></p></a><h3>Men's Ankara styles for shirts</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e5612769bec26fd5.jpg><p class=align-left>Ankara shirts for men are currently among the supper stylish tops. Why? It's because they can be rocked in almost any event, i.e., to church, work, or date. There are several fashionable Ankara styles when it comes to shirts. Here are the best styles to try.</p><h4>Long sleeve shirt (plain sleeves)</h4><p class=align-left>This is the perfect design for someone looking for a short with just a hint of Ankara. The sleeves are made from plain coloured cotton or polyester, while the rest of the shirt has floral or patterned fabric with a colour palette closely matching that of the sleeves.</p><h4>Half plain, half Ankara</h4><p class=align-left>This one takes the Ankara and plain fabric combination even further. One side of the shirt is made from a plain colour fabric while the other half is made from Ankara. In addition, you can have the sleeves in plain or patterned designs.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0c5417d978bd59e4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest roofing designs in Kenya for a bungalow or mansionette</span></p></a><h4>Long sleeve full Ankara</h4><p class=align-left>If you are not looking for something too fancy, a long sleeve full Ankara shirt will definitely do the trick. However, unlike the two options above, this one is made from the same material from top to bottom.</p><h4>Short sleeve round collar</h4><p class=align-left>Nothing screams comfort like a shirt whose design is inspired by the ever-so-comfortable t-shirt. This design incorporates short sleeves and a round collar for that timeless look that can be worn to work or to informal events.</p><h4>Short sleeve Mandarian collar</h4><p class=align-left>The Mandarian collar adds some flair to the somewhat conventional round-neck shirts. This collar has a thin opening from the collar that extends a few inches toward the chest. Again, you can choose to have yours with or without buttons.</p><h3>Jackets</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/07db00a674086d24.jpg><p class=align-left>The modern Ankara jackets are trendy, simple, and cute. They come full of colours, making their unique designs worth purchasing. You can rock them with anything, including jeans, trousers, shorts, Khaki, etc.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a44272f3f839258f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 hairstyles for men with big foreheads that will look great on you</span></p></a><h4>Different halves</h4><p class=align-left>This is one of the best ways to pull off the native African fabric look. Have a patterned fabric on one side of the jacket zipper and a different one on the other side. To enhance the look further, you can go for complementary colours on the two sides.</p><h4>Bold colours</h4><p class=align-left>Bold colours and patterns are among the defining features of African printed fabric. Choose a material with huge floral or abstract patterns and have a waist-length jacket made from it. If you are fine with bright-coloured clothes, the bold patterns or flowers in this look will definitely turn heads.</p><h4>Similar halves</h4><p class=align-left>This is the opposite of the different halves design. If you are the type to choose simplicity over sophistication, then the similar halves jacket is for you. The look is achieved by making the jacket from a single piece of material. This means when the zipper is open, the jacket's two halves look the same.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/93ad04acebc901e7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>80+ formal dress quotes for your stylish Instagram pictures</span></p></a><h4>Ankara and leather</h4><p class=align-left>Leather and faux leather have often been used in the clothing industry. The Ankara and leather combination is achieved by sewing a bit of printed fabric onto a leather jacket. This gives the otherwise boring-looking leather a splash of colour.</p><h4>Hooded jacket</h4><p class=align-left>A hood on top of a jacket is not only stylish but also remarkably functional. If you are looking for an Ankara jacket for cold weather, why not opt for the hooded jacket? You could have the entire jacket in Ankara and the hood in a plain fabric or the other way around.</p><h3>Hats and caps</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0c5417d978bd59e4.jpeg><p class=align-left>Here is a selection of the very best unique custom and handmade pieces to choose from.</p><h4>Full Ankara cap</h4><p class=align-left>You can opt to match the rest of your outfit with a stylish cap. This design has the entire cap made from printed fabric. Feel free to have the cap made from the same material as your African shirt, trouser, or shoes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b34a557d0a44b91.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 creative updo loc hairstyles for women that will inspire you</span></p></a><h4>Black and floral</h4><p class=align-left>Black is well known for matching quite well with numerous other colours. Since African print fabrics typically tend to have bright colours and patterns, you can go for some black on your cap to tone down the otherwise shouting colours in this male Ankara style.</p><h4>A hint of Ankara</h4><p class=align-left>This is the ideal hat and cap design for those wanting some print fabric on their caps but not so much that it attracts too much attention. Feel free to include a hint of printed fabric on a background of your favorite plain colour.</p><h4>Patterned hat</h4><p class=align-left>A slip-on hat with printed fabric patterns or floral elements can be quite a fashion statement, especially when paired with a matching jacket, shirt, or trousers.</p><h4>Plain hat</h4><p class=align-left>This is the conservative version of the patterned hat. While Ankara designs are mostly known for bold florals, patterns, and colours, you can also find them in plain colours. If colour combinations do not appeal to you, you could try the simple African fabric hat.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f512841d5516a2a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>17 easy bandika hairstyles and designs for ladies in 2024</span></p></a><h3>Blazers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/24936bdc06ffc0ed.jpg><p class=align-left>There is a wide choice of plain and pattern Ankara styles for males when it comes to blazers. Here are some of the best blazer styles for all seasons and fits.</p><h4>Single pocket</h4><p class=align-left>The single-pocket blazer design is one of the trendiest ones. Feel free to try out the design with fine-patterned or bold-patterned fabrics.</p><h4>Double pocket</h4><p class=align-left>This is inspired by the double-pocketed coat often seen as part of classy suits. However, unlike in plain fabrics, the pockets are not as conspicuous, most times due to Ankara's floral or pattern elements.</p><h4>Bright on black</h4><p class=align-left>The shirt underneath your blazer is as important as the blazer itself. If you have a bright-coloured blazer, opt for a dark-coloured shirt, such as a black one. This will tone down the blazer's bright colours.</p><h4>Bold colours</h4><p class=align-left>There are always the bold people among us. If you do not mind turning heads everywhere you go, feel free to try a bold-coloured blazer. The colour combination, in this case, is the main attraction and helps <a href=#>draw</a> attention to the blazer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8f3806d72bf578ce.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best lightning tattoo designs with meaning to inspire you</span></p></a><h4>Neutral on white</h4><p class=align-left>If you are a fan of neutral colours, you may want to try your neutral-coloured blazer atop a white shirt underneath. The white will bring out the blazer's colours better than a dark-coloured shirt can.</p><h3>Suits</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a44272f3f839258f.png><p class=align-left>Is the company you work for or your <a href=#>business</a> culture friendly? If yes, these working-class Ankara suits for men are for you. You'll look so sharp in any of them.</p><h4>Buttoned shirt and trouser</h4><p class=align-left>This is one of the simplest African printed fabric suits to pull off. First, ensure the shirt goes past the waist for that coat-like look. You can pull off this look using pretty much any Ankara material; floral, patterned, or plain.</p><h4>Plain agbada and trouser</h4><p class=align-left>The agbada is one of the definitive native Ankara styles for males in <a href=#>West Africa</a>. The shirt-like piece of clothing is a staple of the Nigerian and Ghanaian fashion industries. You can create a suit by matching trousers with your agbada. Go for materials with neutral colours and muted patterns for the best look.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a94144184995b3f3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Unique spine tattoos for women: 20 inspiring designs to choose from</span></p></a><h4>Short sleeve closed shirt and trousers</h4><p class=align-left>If the buttoned shirt does not work for you, feel free to suit up by combining a closed short sleeve shirt with matching trousers. You can have the shirt in a V-neck, round neck, or Mandarian neck design.</p><h4>Boldly patterned agbada and trouser</h4><p class=align-left>While the Agbada suit often looks best with plain or neutral patterns, it can also be worn in bold florals and patterns. If you feel bold enough, try this knee-length bold-coloured agbada worn with matching trousers.</p><h4>Three-piece suit</h4><p class=align-left>This design is as close as Ankara suits get to conventional suits. So pull off this three-piece look by having an oversized shirt, a smaller coat or blazer, and matching trousers.</p><h4>Geometric pattern suit</h4><p class=align-left>Straight lines and other geometric shapes are widely used in printed fabrics to give a fashionable, timeless look. You can try this geometric pattern suit and pair it up with plain shoes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cb11fbaa15207330.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 feminine classy thigh tattoos ideas for women in 2023</span></p></a><h4>Ankara senator suit</h4><p class=align-left>It's no secret that a lot of folks like the senators. There are several Ankara senator styles for guys, but it depends on the material's patterns, designs, and colours. For example, you can choose the white <a href=#>Ankara styles</a> for guys to look elegant and cute. Senators are ideal for everyday wear, office days, business meetings, and other special occasions.</p><h3>Men's Ankara design for ties</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/93ad04acebc901e7.jpg><p class=align-left>As a man, you must always look good, and the Ankara ties will make this easy for you. Here are some of the latest Ankara styles for men's ties that you should try.</p><h4>Matching tie and accent piece</h4><p class=align-left>Have your tailor make you an accent piece to match your tie, and you have a killer combination. The look is particularly amazing when done with bold colours that complement the rest of your outfit.</p><h4>Two-tone tie</h4><p class=align-left>This design is perfect for those who love the African print design but cannot withstand the often-numerous colours included in a single piece of clothing—the two-tone combo results in one of the best male Ankara designs in 2022.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0756f2afe21c26e9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who has the longest neck in the world?

Go for a combination of bold colours that do not clash. You can wear the tie with a plain coloured shirt, ensuring the tie becomes the center of attention.</p><h4>Multi-colour bowtie</h4><p class=align-left>If regular ties are not your thing, try the Ankara bowtie design. From its bold colours to the matching accent piece, this seemingly simple piece of clothing is enough to give your overall look some flair.</p><h3>Shoes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/321d40fa8b0d235e.jpg><p class=align-left>Ankara shoes will indeed display your creativity and stylishness. Here are some trendy Ankara shoe designs for men.</p><h4>Denim and Ankara</h4><p class=align-left>These trendy casual shoes are made using a combination of printed fabric and denim. Often finished with a white or black sole, the combo is among the most fashionable when it comes to men's footwear. Add some bright-coloured laces to complete the look.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6b6dea6d7937fc9e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best Christmas hairstyles to rock this festive season</span></p></a><h4>Velcro</h4><p class=align-left>Velcro shoes have always been associated with comfort and convenience. The design combines the easy-to-wear convenience of slip-on shoes with the stay-in-place assurance of conventional lace shoes. In addition, the black front section of the shoe creates some balancing contrast with the bright-coloured fabric on the rest of the shoe.</p><h4>Converse-inspired</h4><p class=align-left>Converse rubber shoes are inarguably among the most common pieces of male footwear. You can wear the design even more fashionably by having the shoes' upper part made from African printed fabric.</p><h4>All fabric</h4><p class=align-left>This is the best way to match your shoes to your favorite <a href=#>Ankara shorts</a> or trousers. The all-fabric shoes are made from printed fabric, making them as much of a fashion statement as the rest of your outfits.</p><h4>Formal shoes</h4><p class=align-left>Who said printed fabric is only suitable for casual shoes? Well, the fabric on formal shoes is sparingly used since you would not want to attract too much attention to your multi-coloured shoes while at a board meeting. Still, when done correctly, these are some of the most stylish formal shoes you can rock to the office.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0b603e1957b7863d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 cutest mother and daughter Ankara dress styles and ideas</span></p></a><h3>Belts and suspenders</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b34a557d0a44b91.png><p class=align-left>Here are some beautiful Ankara suspender and belt designs for men.</p><h4>Muted colours</h4><p class=align-left>A belt with neutral colours is best for a trouser made with bright-coloured <a href=#>printed fabric</a>. Make sure not to wear the belt on top of neutral-coloured trousers or shorts since the overall look might turn out too bland.</p><h4>Bright-coloured belt</h4><p class=align-left>Ankara is all about colour, right? And how better to bring out those colours than by wearing a multi-colour belt? Go for bright colours such as yellow, orange, pink, and purple to make the belt more visible.</p><h4>Patterned</h4><p class=align-left>When choosing an African print fabric belt, you can never go wrong with any colour. Still, go a notch higher and opt for patterned belts. These create a minimalist sense of geometry, making the belt even more appealing.</p><h4>Matching suspender and bowtie</h4><p class=align-left>If you are a fan of classy, elegant suspenders, why not try an Ankara suspender? Pair the suspender with a matching bowtie to enhance the look even further for the perfect semi-casual look.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/47f9a49cd5a17daa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 cute gel hairstyles with extensions ideas to try out in 2022</span></p></a><h4>Suspender on black and white</h4><p class=align-left>While a black and white outfit might look boring and too conventional, you can throw in some bright-coloured Ankara suspenders for that much-needed splash of colour.</p><h3>Hoodies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f512841d5516a2a.jpeg><p class=align-left>Here are some amazing Ankara hoodie designs for males to rock.</p><h4>Chest printed</h4><p class=align-left>This one has printed fabric across the chest area, with the rest of the hoodie made from plain-coloured cotton.

The map will appear best against a neutral-coloured background, so make sure not to have additional floral or patterned fabric behind the image.</p><h4>Pocket printed</h4><p class=align-left>If you are looking for a way to wear a regular hoodie with a hint of Ankara, look no further than the pocket-printed hoodie.

While most of them are digitally printed, you can have your 'his' title made using Ankara against a plain colour background.</p><h4>Zippered</h4><p class=align-left>There are numerous reasons zippered hoodies are quite popular, one of them being the sheer convenience of having a zip. Feel free to try this design but with Ankara instead of the typical materials.</p><h3>Trousers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/57ed17ec928f7165.jpg><p class=align-left>Here is a look at the best Ankara trousers designs for men.</p><h4>Floral</h4><p class=align-left>While bold floral patterns might not be synonymous with men's trousers, the design actually works when implemented correctly. Go for patterns with a few colours to avoid the oversaturated look. You can pair up the trouser with a matching or plain shirt or T-shirt.</p><h4>Ankle pants</h4><p class=align-left>Ankle pants are all the rage right now, and rightly so. You can wear Ankara ankle pants with loafers, open shoes, or even some formal shoes. Make sure the trousers' fabric slims down near the lower end for a modern, classy look.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8fd7b0a4e228c912.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 cutest square acrylic nail designs to try out in 2022</span></p></a><h4>Checked</h4><p class=align-left>It is hard to go wrong with checked pants, regardless of the material, and Ankara trousers are no exception. Go for simple checked patterns in medium or small sizes.</p><h4>Pinstripes</h4><p class=align-left>The pinstripe has been a staple of <a href=#>expensive suits</a> for quite some time, and it is easy to see why. Pinstripes look amazing, especially when done on two-tone trousers. Feel free to pair it up with a plain jacket or coat or extend the pinstripe look to your top.</p><h4>Plain</h4><p class=align-left>While plain Ankara is not very common, it can still be found and fashioned into elegant clothing. The plain-coloured trousers can be paired with a bold floral printed shirt, blazer, or hoodie.</p><h3>Bags</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8f3806d72bf578ce.png><p class=align-left>A bag is among the best Ankara accessories to match your outfit.
