She’s also terrifically unconcerned about aging. “I just don’t pay any attention to it,” she says “I mean, it is what it is. And I don’t think there’s anything to be ashamed of in getting older.”</p><p>Candice’s glamorous days of dining with Grace Kelly and Monaco’s Prince Rainier may be behind her, but she has no regrets about <a href=#>her current life</a>. She recently became a first-time grandmother, is costarring in the <strong>Steven Soderbergh</strong>–directed film Let Them All Talk with <strong>Meryl Streep</strong> and <strong>Dianne Wiest</strong>, and is selling her hand-designed merchandise online. “I would like to embrace being 74,” she says. “I mean, my hair is white…I have a wattle.”</p><p>Any resentment she once felt about people not seeing beyond her beauty has been resolved. “Candice is an eternal optimist,” an insider tells Closer. “And her confidence has definitely increased with age. She’s learned not to be affected by fame and is comfortable with who she is.”</p><p>She wasn’t always so sanguine. When she started out, acting in such films as The Group and The Sand Pebbles, Candice was conflicted about her beauty. “Doctors used to come up to me and say could they take a cast of my nose,” she recalls. She bristled at not being taken seriously: “That’s all you are to people is what you look like.”</p><p>But as she strove to establish her own identity, she found solace in photography and writing, which she still pursues. And her acting success continued with her Oscar-nominated role in Starting Over and, of course, with <a href=#>Murphy Brown</a>, which she called “the perfect character… she was appealing and annoying!”</p><p>FAMILY MATTERS</p><p>More than career or fame, however, family has been important to Candice, especially after she married her first husband, director Louis Malle, and had their daughter, Chloe. “The birth of my daughter was the greatest event in my life,” she says. And now with “the dumpling,” as she calls 6-month- old grandson Artie, she couldn’t be happier. He’s “the best arrival of joy in one’s life,” she raves.</p><p>Candice’s life continues to be very full. In addition to promoting Let Them All Talk, streaming now on HBO Max, she’s been spending time watching The West Wing and eating vegetarian meals with her second husband, real estate developer <strong>Marshall Rose</strong>. She’s so relaxed, her daughter Chloe notes, Candice “has been strolling through Central Park with [her dog] Bruce in her pajamas and the coat she got on Amazon, her hair sticking up.”</p><p>Candice may be living a less glittery life, but she shows no signs of slowing down. She even has another new film, with <strong>Dustin Hoffman</strong>, in the works. She also hopes to set an example by continuing to fully embrace this time in her life. “It’s important for younger women to know that it’s not over until it’s over,” she says, adding that at any age, “Your life can be infinitely rich and engaging and sexy.”</p><p>— Lisa Chambers, with reporting by Natalie Posner</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mrKuomK56o77OsKWsZZOWu6W1wp5km52inLKvecisZJqmXZrBpr7NmqNmp6Cptq610q1kmqxdbIFw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./scotty-mccreery-2023-damn-strait-tour-dates.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Scotty McCreery Announces 2023 Damn Strait Tour Dates</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lupita-nyongo-shows-incredible-figure-tiny-bikini-celebrates-good-times-getaway-cancun-surprise-split-selema-masekela-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lupita Nyong'o shows off her incredible figure in tiny bikini as she celebrates 'good times' during</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
