His latest outing as the Norse God came in 2022's Thor: Love and Thunder, and Hemsworth is sorry about that.</p><p>After the previous film, 2017's Thor: Ragnarok, was hit with rave reviews as new director <a href=#><strong>Taika Waititi</strong></a> and Hemsworth leaned a little more into the humor, they perhaps took it too far with the franchise's fourth outing.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a99ea1e5-bbc4-44dc-92a3-aa2bbdbd7864 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0e999624-b3ce-47df-b2a5-2d072c65c2bf data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/00/5by4/2022/11/18/00fc5d4341be42f8935131cec00aaf1b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Chris Hemsworth Thinks He's Ready to Say Goodbye to Thor with One Final Film</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>It was a long, difficult journey with Hemsworth and the character, with the actor admitting to <a href=#><strong>Vanity Fair</strong></a> in a new cover story interview, "Sometimes I felt like a security guard for the team."</p><p>He went on to elaborate, explaining, "I would read everyone else’s lines, and go, Oh, they got way cooler stuff. They’re having more fun. What's my character doing?"</p><p>"It was always about, 'You've got the wig on. You've got the muscles. You've got the costume. Where's the lighting?' Yeah, I'm part of this big thing, but I'm probably pretty replaceable."</p><p>While Hemsworth was notably hard on himself in the role, his MCU co-star <a href=#><strong>Robert Downey Jr.</strong></a>, who won fans over as egocentric Tony Stark (aka <a href=#><strong>Iron Man</strong></a>), had nothing but praise for what he's done with the challenging character.</p><p>"First off, Thor as a character was super tricky to adapt -- lots of implied limitations -- but he and [first director] Ken Branagh figured out how to transcend, make him somehow relatable but godlike," Downey said.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:15540362-4b28-4045-a31c-3aebf4ef8ddf data-container-ref=toofab:article:0e999624-b3ce-47df-b2a5-2d072c65c2bf data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ec/5by4/2023/11/28/ec3fdec3a4a94d82b9c8ec2c980c4642_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Taika Waititi Only Directed Thor Because He Was 'Poor'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Hemsworth is, in my opinion, the most complex psyche out of all us Avengers. He's got wit and gravitas, but also such restraint, fire, and gentleness." He described Hemsworth's first three Thor films as "a formidable hat trick."</p><p>He notably left out the fourth and final film (so far), Love and Thunder. Hemsworth would not disagree, though, telling VF, "I got caught up in the improv and the wackiness, and I became a parody of myself. I didn't stick the landing."</p><p>This isn't the first time Hemsworth has been less-than-flattering about Thor: Love and Thunder. In June 2023, he <a href=#><strong>walked back</strong></a> some of his harsher comments in a <a href=#><strong>British GQ</strong></a> interview while chatting with <a href=#><strong>Yahoo! Entertainment</strong></a>.</p><p>In the aforementioned GQ interview, he said of the negative reception. that they "just had too much fun. It just became too silly." The actor then qualified those remarks, telling Yahoo! "I was a little silly. Not silly -- we were having so much fun, and that's sometimes too much of a good thing."</p><p>"I still love the film," continued the Australian actor. "You have to critique and look at what worked in case you do it again on a different film. The lesson I took was have fun with the comedy and so on, but what's the emotional drive and component here? Is this something relatable?"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:24d51ecc-1086-425c-8e9c-0353c9985d3a data-container-ref=toofab:article:0e999624-b3ce-47df-b2a5-2d072c65c2bf data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7d/5by4/2023/06/16/7d0676dd4c874b43a3369288afeefc3f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Disney / Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Chris Hemsworth Walks Back Criticisms of Thor: Love and Thunder</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Then you can add on all the jokes and the fantastical special effects and the elements," he finished. "But if there's not a strong enough through-line, sometimes you're just having too much fun."</p><p>He also suspects that a fifth Thor outing would probably be his last, telling VF in 2022, "I feel like we'd probably have to close the book if I ever did it again. I feel like it probably warrants that. I feel like it'd probably be the finale, but that's not based on anything anyone's told me or any sort of plans."</p><p>The way he sees it, though, "You have this birth of a hero, the journey of a hero, then the death of a hero, and I don't know -- am I at that stage? Who knows?"</p><p>Whether or not he's able to give fans a fifth Thor movie remains to be seen, but the actor effortlessly slid into another beloved franchise, joining the prequel film <a href=#><strong>Furiosa: A Mad Max Story</strong></a> -- though you might have to squint under that prosthetic nose, beard and brown contacts to recognize him.</p><p>Hemsworth stars as Warlord Dementus alongside <a href=#><strong>Anya Taylor-Joy's</strong></a> Imperator Furiosa, Lachy Hulme's Immortan Joe, and Tom Burke's Praetorian Jack. Furiosa: A Mad Max Story hits theaters May 24.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2efea88a-5625-49f3-96c4-15d906d4e8c2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0e999624-b3ce-47df-b2a5-2d072c65c2bf data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/91/5by4/2023/11/30/91888934c2ce4b36b6b7e90d2af11cde_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Warner Bros.</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Furiosa Trailer Features Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth & More Wild Stunts for Mad Max Prequel</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21mbGhfmLWztdJmn56lo6y8s8DHZp2epKRiv6a8y5qanpmSobJuwMeoqWakn6uybq3NnWStoKWjsaa%2BjKmYq6eUrnqwsoymsKydnJt8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carin-kingsland.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carin Kingsland - Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Facts, Nationality</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./496212-shakira-slams-husband-gerard-piques-lover-months-breakup-place-reserved.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shakira Slams Ex-Husband Gerard Piqu's New Lover Months after Breakup: &amp;quot;Special Place in Hell&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
