With A Raisin in the Sun, she brought three Black women to the apex of American theater: Lena Younger, the matriarch with a sense of humor and spiritual conviction; Ruth Younger, a domestic who was exploring reproductive choices and longed for a place in the world; and Beneatha, a hardheaded feminist and brilliant yet sophomoric future doctor.</p><img alt="diana sands sidney poitier claudia mcneil and ruby dee in the original broadway production of lorraine hansberrys a raisin ﻿in the sun 1959" title="Claudia McNeil/Sidney Poitier, New York, USA" width=1800 height=1800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-019-65765e2dc23f3.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">GORDON PARKS/THE LIFE PICTURE COLLECTION/SHUTTERSTOCK</span><p>Diana Sands, Sidney Poitier, Claudia McNeil, and Ruby Dee in the original Broadway production of Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun, 1959.</p><img alt="lorraine hansberry in her west village apartment 1959" title="Lorraine Hansberry Portrait Session" width=1800 height=1796 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-002-65765e941f944.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">DAVID ATTIE/GETTY IMAGES</span><p>Hansberry in her West Village apartment, 1959.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It would be 17 years before another production written by a Black woman appeared on Broadway; Ntozake Shange’s for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf premiered at the Booth Theatre in the fall of 1976. Shange, who also performed in early versions of for colored girls, brought a new dramatic form to the stage: the choreopoem, which combines poetry, movement, music, and song. Seven Black female characters act as a chorus of autoethnographic voices and bodies telling deeply resonant and radically honest stories of the cruelty they’ve endured and the love they’ve carried inside their tender interior lives.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>These playwrights and storytellers forged a tradition that is now flourishing in the 21st century.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The Storytellers Remaking American Theater" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/1fe53f66-5c54-463d-ae7b-2f3cf86ed0ed/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1702484995_13567.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hansberry and Shange transformed American theater. They brought characters and stories—Black people with real problems and passionate dreams—that had been historically disregarded. And yet they also stood in a tradition of Black theater that had existed for decades in the shadows of the American drama scene, from the women writers and directors of historical chronicle pageants of the 1920s to the blues queens of the 1930s and the dramatists at Black colleges and universities in the pre–Civil Rights era. Together, slowly but surely, these playwrights and storytellers forged a tradition that is now flourishing in the 21st century.</p><img alt="ntozake shange right in a scene from her play for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf a seven woman ensemble that was nominated for a tony award in 1977" title="Ntozake Shange Acting in a Scene from Her Broadway Play" width=1875 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-003-6576377f836e7.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bettmann/Getty Images</span><p>Ntozake Shange (right) in the original Broadway production of her play for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf, 1976</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">The Spanish poet and playwright Federico García Lorca once described theater as “poetry that rises from the book and becomes human enough to talk and shout, weep and despair.” Indeed, what we have witnessed on the American stage over the past three decades is the emergence of what is now multiple generations of playwrights and dramatists who have tilled, seeded, and harvested the grounds laid by Hansberry, Shange, and so many others in order to shout and despair, but also appeal and sing.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>They represent a sea change in the American theater, breaking down old boundaries.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They are Pulitzer, MacArthur, Obie, Tony, and Grammy winners. They are writers, actors, singers, composers, dancers, choreographers, and producers. They are African, Caribbean, African American, and multiracial. They embrace a great diversity of identities and experiences. They are both formally trained and self-taught. But collectively, they represent a sea change in the American theater, breaking down old boundaries around whose stories matter and who gets to tell them and how and when and where, creating space for the others who follow in their stead.</p><img alt="anna deavere smith in the 1992 off broadway production of her one woman play fires in the mirror crown heights brooklyn and other identities" title="anna deavere smith in the 1992 off broadway production of her one woman play fires in the mirror crown heights brooklyn and other identities" width=1721 height=2152 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-017-65773211b8f67.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MICHAL DANIEL</span><p>Anna Deavere Smith in the 1992 Off-Broadway production of her one-woman play Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other Identities.</p><img alt="sarah jones in the off broadway premiere of her one woman show bridge and tunnel 2004" title=BRIDGE width=1875 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-018-657732d5e9e0d.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times/Redux</span><p>Sarah Jones in the Off- Broadway premiere of her one-woman show Bridge & Tunnel, 2004.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Before her illustrious career as an actor, Anna Deavere Smith collected the stories of people impacted by the 1991 riots in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and embodied them in her 1992 one-woman play, Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other Identities. A decade later, Suzan-Lori Parks became the first Black woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for Topdog/Underdog (2001), her creative remixing of the assassination of Lincoln through the lives of two contemporary Black male hustlers. Parks and Lynn Nottage—the only woman to have won the Pulitzer for Drama twice, for 2008’s Ruined and 2015’s Sweat—have each explored social conflict and the interior lives of those who experience it in their work. They both also made clear from the beginnings of their careers that they were intent on bringing not just their own narratives but their histories to the stage.</p><img alt="topdog underdog public theater don cheadle and jeffrey wright" title="topdog underdog public theater don cheadle and jeffrey wright" width=1875 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-015-6576431f21176.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MICHAL DANIEL</span><p>Don Cheadle and Jeffrey Wright in the 2001 Off-Broadway production of Suzan-Lori Parks’s Pulitzer Prize– winning Topdog/Underdog.</p><img alt="file saidah arrika ekulona and russell gebert jones in the manhattan theater club production of lynn nottages pulitzer winning ruined" title="Saidah Arrika Ekulona and Russell Gebert Jones in the Manhattan Theater Club production of Lynn Nottage's Pulitzer-winning &amp;amp;quot;Ruined&amp;amp;quot; in New York." width=1875 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-004-657643fed328e.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times/Redux</span><p>Saidah Arrika Ekulona and Russell Gebert Jones in the 2009 Off-Broadway production of Lynn Nottage’s Pulitzer Prize–winning Ruined.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One cannot help but think of the African American folk tradition of play-acting—an organic local theater so marvelously documented by the anthropologist, playwright, and novelist Zora Neale Hurston, who recognized how the act of performing was an act of self-liberation for “the mules of the world” (a quip Hurston used to describe Black women). In 1998, Sarah Jones followed in Smith’s footsteps by using her own singular Black and female body and intellect to share the stories of victims and perpetrators of hate in her one-woman show Surface Transit.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>There is a thin veil between the past and the present when we live haunted by history<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Others have embarked on bodies of work that identify them as creative historians. Katori Hall’s The Mountaintop, a speculative story of Martin Luther King Jr.’s last night as a living man, catapulted her to fame in 2009. Dominique Morisseau’s Detroit cycle—Detroit ’67 (2013), Paradise Blue (2015), and Skeleton Crew (2016)—retells the story of the Black industrial North. Antoinette Chinonye Nwandu's Pass Over (2017), inspired by the killing of Trayvon Martin, meditates on contemporary Black collective grief, while Erika Dickerson-Despenza’s shadow/land (2021) and cullud wattah (2021) explore the trauma, devastation, and fallout from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and the Flint, Michigan, water crisis respectively.</p><img alt="breayre tender during a performance of dominique morrisseaus detroit 67" title="Breayre Tender during a performance of &amp;amp;quot;Detroit '67&amp;amp;quot; at the Osborn Neighborhood Alliance in Detroit." width=1800 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-007-65764645bc2e6.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LAURA McDERMOTT/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX</span><p>Breayre Tender in Dominique Morisseau’s Detroit ’67 at Detroit’s Osborn Neighborhood Alliance, 2017.</p><img alt="lupita nyongo and saycon sengbloh in eclipsed written by danai gurira" title="lupita nyongo and saycon sengbloh in eclipsed written by danai gurira" width=1500 height=1875 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-012-65764bfd5b2be.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Joan Marcus</span><p>Lupita Nyong’o and Saycon Sengbloh in an Off-Broadway production of Danai Gurira’s Eclipsed, 2015.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These playwrights have also gifted American theater with a vast geography of the sort anticipated and yearned for by Hansberry and Shange, who wrote creatively and critically about West Africa and the Caribbean, respectively. Nottage, Danai Gurira, and Jackie Sibblies Drury have all depicted the stories of African women whose lives have been deeply shaped by the legacies of colonialism, neocolonialism, and patriarchy. In doing so, they’ve brought regions and histories often marginalized in the American political imagination to the center of American theatrical life. Nottage’s Ruined tells the story of a group of women during the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while Gurira’s Eclipsed (2009) offers a window into the lives of five women amid the civil strife in Liberia. Drury’s We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia (2012) forces us to remember the internationally “forgotten” German-led early-20th-century genocide in South West Africa.</p><img alt="namir smallwood and jon michael hill in pass over" title="Namir Smallwood, left, and Jon Michael Hill in &amp;amp;quot;Pass Over,&amp;amp;quot; which opened in August at Broadway's August Wilson Theater in New York, Aug. 2, 2021.

In 2022, nonagenarian Adrienne Kennedy finally (and much belatedly) made her Broadway debut with Ohio State Murders (1991), one of her plays focused on the life of the recurring fictional character Suzanne Alexander—an intelligent, manic, educated Black woman whose life is lightning-struck by every upheaval of the contemporary world. As creative beings, Nottage, Gurira, and Drury all understand what Suzanne feels: that there is a thin veil between the past and the present when we live haunted by history and survive against all odds, with our creative maladjustment and brilliance in tow.</p><img alt="playwright adrienne kennedy 1969" title="Adrienne Kennedy" width=1800 height=1800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-001-6576639950124.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">JACK ROBINSON/GETTY IMAGES</span><p>Playwright Adrienne Kennedy, 1969.</p><img alt="audra mcdonald and abigail stephenson at a dress rehearsal for the original broadway production of adrienne kennedys ohio state murders 2022" title="audra mcdonald and abigail stephenson at a dress rehearsal for the original broadway production of adrienne kennedys ohio state murders 2022" width=1875 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-014-657664011a2ca.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MARTHA SWOPE © BILLY ROSE THEATRE DIVISION, THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS</span><p>Audra McDonald and Abigail Stephenson at a dress rehearsal for the original Broadway production of Kennedy’s Ohio State Murders, 2022.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A stage is a specific place, but it can carry us anywhere and everywhere. This past fall, the Harlem braid shop was transported to the Theater District in Jocelyn Bioh’s Jaja’s African Hair Braiding. Other playwrights have taken us into psychological and virtual spaces, such as Jasmine Lee-Jones with her forays into meme culture (Seven Methods of Killing Kylie Jenner, 2019) and Ife Olujobi with her commentary on consumerism and identity.

The newest kid on this particular block, Alicia Keys, is undoubtedly the most famous. A 15-time Grammy winner and multiplatinum recording artist, Keys opened her semiautobiographical musical, Hell’s Kitchen, at the Public Theater in November. With a book by Kristoffer Diaz and choreography by Camille A. Brown, it deals, in part, with her experience growing up in the orbit of Manhattan’s Theater District.</p><img alt="billy eugene jones and marcel spears in the new york premiere production of pulitzer prize winner fat ham, written by james ijames co produced by national black theatre and the public theater" title="billy eugene jones and marcel spears in the new york premiere production of pulitzer prize winner fat ham, written by james ijames co produced by national black theatre and the public theater" width=1875 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-011-657649bd5c67f.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Joan Marcus</span><p>Billy Eugene Jones and Marcel Spears in the New York premiere of James Ijames’s Fat Ham, coproduced by National Black Theatre and the Public Theater, 2022.</p><img alt="between the world and me apollo theater 2018" title="between the world and me apollo theater 2018" width=1875 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-010-65765476cc612.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Shahar Azran</span><p>The Apollo Theater’s 2018 stage adaptation of Ta-Nehisi Coates’s book Between the World and Me, directed by Kamilah Forbes and executive produced by Forbes and Coates.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Keys has obviously distinguished herself mightily in music, but her decision to enter another field is both a singular act and one that sits fully in the experimental tradition of Black women in the performing arts. Her collaborator on Hell’s Kitchen, Brown, has herself famously refused the silos of the profession, directing the 2022 Broadway revival of Shange’s for colored girls, which was nominated for seven Tonys. Brown’s staging highlighted the cultural significance of movement in drama in a way that Shange, who also trained as a dancer, would no doubt have cherished.</p><img alt="hells kitchen rehearsal" title="hells kitchen rehearsal" width=1875 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-016-657648a2e6d59.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Joan Marcus</span><p>Rehearsals for the Public Theater production of Alicia Keys’s Hell’s Kitchen, 2023.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">As much as each of these individuals has garnered attention and acclaim, there remains a stunning silence about what it means that they are all working and thriving today.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although it is well established that there was a late-mid-20th-century renaissance of Black women fiction writers, Black women playwrights have rarely been collectively recognized in quite the same way. Even Toni Morrison, perhaps the most influential Black American writer in history, began in the theater as a member of Howard University’s Howard Players. It is an urgent sisterhood. It seems that every week we read a new headline about one of the crises facing not just Black women but also Black femme, trans, and nonbinary people, whether it relates to maternal mortality or high rates of poverty, isolation, and discrimination. This renaissance is a literal form of fighting back with a chorus of noble self-regard.</p><img alt="the company of the 2019 production of for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf choreographed by camille a brown" title="the company of the 2019 production of for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf choreographed by camille a brown" width=1875 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-013-6576493fb53c3.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Joan Marcus</span><p>The cast of the 2019 Public Theater production of Ntozake Shange’s for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf, choreographed by Camille A.

But integration is a tricky word. It can simply mean that people of color cross a color line and fit themselves into a given setting without disturbing too much of what’s already there. At its best, though, integration is democratic—meaning that when more people participate in an endeavor, the very nature of it changes. Even though barriers remain, it is also true that theater just isn’t the same now that these playwrights and theater-makers have claimed space. They have expanded the idea of what theater is and can be.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">James Baldwin once asked a Black woman who attended the original Broadway production of A Raisin in the Sun what made her choose to go to the theater over a movie, which was much less expensive. The woman responded that she decided to come downtown from Harlem to see the play because something was happening that had to do with her. It was a pointed, potent statement. The task these creative forces and facilitators have taken up is to pronounce that the world must have something to do with them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nottage has said that her interest in theater began when she listened to the stories told by Black women in her mother’s kitchen. Today, organizations such as the Lillys, a nonprofit group founded by and for women in theater, are investing in the next generation of talent through projects like the Lorraine Hansberry Initiative, which Nottage is leading along with the executive director of the Lillys, Julia Jordan, to provide graduate fellowships and support for women and nonbinary playwrights of color. The Barnard Center for Research on Women, the Public Theater, and the Ntozake Shange Literary Trust have also partnered to establish a residency for women, femme, and nonbinary playwrights of the African diaspora.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nevertheless, writers and dramatists of those identities are still among the most underrepresented on the American stage, often unheeded, frequently stereotyped, and rarely considered, despite the intellectual robustness and tremendous diversity of their work—in content, subject, and form. But they bloom nonetheless. They insist that there is no single story that defines us, that there are myriad roads and routes through our lives. And they lead us to them with aplomb, dignity, and grace.</p><img alt="a group of playwrights and theater makers" title="a group of playwrights and theater makers" width=2250 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123wellwomenintheater-020-657633055daf9.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Edmonds</span>Back row, from left, on Kamilah Forbes: Dress, Jason Wu Collection.
