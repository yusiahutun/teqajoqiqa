It’s fairly extensive but fun, with a series of outfits you give a thumbs up or a thumbs downs to. Even if you’re not a fan of the entire look, you can approve elements of it; say, you like the strappy sandals but want to nix a pair of cargo pants. You also tell them your height, weight, and how you prefer your clothing to fit. Stitch Fix is part data-driven and part stylist-picked, so you have both an algorithm and a fashion professional on your side. Because of this, no two Fixes (what Stitch Fix calls the boxes) are the same.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Price, of course, is a top concern too. You wouldn’t want a $500 dress tempting you in your Fix if your budget is closer to $50. For each clothing category, you tell Stitch Fix how much you typically spend or are willing to spend on tops, dresses, jewelry, and more.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can also leave a note for your stylist, detailing any particular do’s and don’ts. For me, patterns are generally a no-go, though I’m down for interesting silhouettes. For the most part, I stick to neutrals, but a pop of red is always welcome. I have enough jeans to last a lifetime, so I’d love to stock my closet with breezy summer dresses. My stylist, Jenna, had her work cut out for her.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Megan McCarty / InStyle</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After deciding on what items you’d like to keep, exchange, and/or return, head to the Stitch Fix site and detail how the sizing, style, fit, quality, and price aligned with your needs and expectations. You can also leave comments on individual pieces, as well as request the same or a different stylist. While the feedback and return process is a little tedious, this will help really hone in on your style for future Fixes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some advice: Don’t delay trying on your items, as I did. You have a small window of just three days to check out and return any unwanted pieces. Life distracted me and—oops!—three days came and went. The good news is that Stitch Fix allows you to extend that window up to a couple of weeks if need be. Just don’t forget to pick a new return date. If you do, your card on file will be charged for the whole box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Each Fix’s delivery frequency is up to you. There are options for a fresh box every two to three weeks, every month, every other month, or every three months. I opted for none of those, instead changing my subscription to on-demand.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-much-is-stitch-fix></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Much Is Stitch Fix?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Upon opening a Stitch Fix account, you’ll be charged a $20 styling fee, which is credited toward any pieces you keep. The $20 fee applies to every Fix, but so does the credit. As long as you plan on keeping at least one item from each box, the service is essentially free. In that way, Stitch Fix is definitely worth it. On the other hand, if you use Stitch Fix to play dress up and continually return everything? Not so much.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pieces range in cost too, from under $50 to over $200. You set the parameters for that in your style profile, so each piece should fit comfortably in your budget. Best of all, if you love everything your stylist sent and keep the entire box, you’ll receive a 25 percent discount on the total price of the items in your Fix.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shipping is also free, and so are returns. (Though you do have to make a field trip to the post office.) Beware of checking out and returning the pieces on time though. If you don’t, your credit card on file will be charged for the total of all five pieces.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-delivery-and-packaging></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Delivery and Packaging</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Megan McCarty / InStyle</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just five days after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="subid1=${DOC_ID}&subid2=${REQUEST_ID}">requesting a box</a>, my first Stitch Fix arrived neatly packaged on my doorstep. I knew when it was coming too, since Stitch Fix sent a tracking number as soon as it was shipped—the day after I took the style quiz. (Yes, I did excitedly watch out my window for my delivery person to arrive.)&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Upon opening the Fix, I was immediately impressed at how efficiently the pieces were packaged in the just-big-enough box. Recyclable kraft paper wrapped all five pieces in a bundle—no plastic, no excess, no need to immediately take a trip to the recycling bin with arms full of packaging. Best yet, Stitch Fix boxes are made from 100 percent post-recycled material that isn’t derived from ancient or endangered forests.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Along with the five pieces of clothing, the box contained a receipt detailing the cost of each item, a prepaid return mailing bag, a small trend report, and a printout with a note from my stylist, Jenna, and ways to style each piece she sent.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-2 mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Megan McCarty / InStyle</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s what Jenna picked out: a gray Eileen Fisher knit dress, a pair of toffee-colored Studio Blue shorts, a nude Violet & Roses bodysuit, a white top from Michael Stars, and a black jumpsuit from Kaileigh. In what I considered a mild miracle, each piece fit perfectly. I also appreciated that there was a cohesive color story; that way the pieces could not only be mixed and matched with each other but also rotated into what I already own and love.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The box also included a note from Jenna, as well as visuals showing how I could wear each piece—super helpful if you need a little assistance seeing your stylist’s vision. While everything was packaged well and informative, I had mixed feelings about the clothes in my Fix. Two of the pieces (the dress and jumpsuit) would seamlessly blend into my wardrobe, two of the other pieces I wasn’t impressed with, as I didn’t love the fit or fabric of the top or shorts. And while I was initially weary of the bodysuit’s tone, once I tried it on, I was pleasantly surprised with how flattering and versatile it was. Considering how picky I can be—really, really picky—I consider two-and-a-half likes out of five pieces a win. Ultimately, though, I didn’t keep anything from my Stitch Fix box. While I could see myself wearing the dress or jumpsuit often, they were too similar to pieces I already own.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-quality-of-clothing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Quality of Clothing</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, I was impressed with the cuts and quality of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="subid1=${DOC_ID}&subid2=${REQUEST_ID}">Stitch Fix's clothes</a>. You could definitely feel which pieces were made from synthetic material, but the trade-off for those was a lower price point. I can be particular about fabric and generally prefer linen and organic cotton, but if synthetics don’t bother you, Stitch Fix can stock your closet with plenty of trendy yet timeless pieces on a budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pros-and-cons></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pros and Cons</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Introduces you to new styles and silhouettes</li><li>Stylist curates box based on your likes and needs</li><li>Comes with prepaid postage for returning items</li><li>Site is easy to navigate</li><li>Box arrives within a few days</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Must return items within three days or request an extension</li><li>Not for picky types</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-should-use-stitch-fix></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who Should Use Stitch Fix?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Too busy to shop?
