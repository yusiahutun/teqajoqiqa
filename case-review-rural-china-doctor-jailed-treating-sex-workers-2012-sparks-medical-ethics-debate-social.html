He was fined 5,000 yuan (US$690) and sentenced to 18 months in prison, Xiaoxiang Morning Herald reported.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although the crime happened more than a decade ago, the case was recently reviewed by lawyer Fu Shifeng, who believed it had been misjudged.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His take on the case quickly went viral in the mainland media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/04/aeeeae5c-6f6e-4c24-b415-25d92137d35b_f67d3284.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The story first emerged in 2008 when the owner of a foot massage centre, surnamed Li, contacted a man, surnamed Feng, who was operating an unlicensed clinic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Li told Feng that one of his employees was ill and asked him to visit her at home.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite having no professional qualifications, Feng agreed to see the patient. His treatment was a success and he become a regular doctor for Li’s workers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Feng realised the massage centre also offered sex services, but he chose not to report it to the local authorities or police.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He believed his responsibility as a doctor was to care for patients regardless of their profession. However, he was also worried about his unlicensed practice being exposed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was investigated and arrested by police in May 2011.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Feng launched an appeal but failed to overturn the decision because it was assumed he was helping Li run his sex-for-sale business.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Huang Mingru, a criminal law professor at Xiangtan University, said providing medical services for sex workers is not a crime, regardless of whether he or she is aware of whom they are treating.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He added that doctors have a duty of care and anybody is entitled to seek medical help.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Feng had a responsibility to report his patient if he was aware of any unlawful activity, but it does not mean he was personally committing a crime,” Huang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Feng, who served his sentence a decade ago, told the Herald he does not want to dwell on that difficult time. His concern now is that his criminal record might have a negative impact on his child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/04/a46a866a-1034-4c0c-b1fb-359ebec7afd0_3a12c2a0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many online observers on mainland social media agreed with the law professor’s view, while a few supported the court’s decision.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Feng’s calling is to help people and not do harm to others. It’s really a wrong verdict,” one person said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What is the duty of a doctor? Isn’t it to save people?” another said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He is not licensed, so he isn’t a doctor,” a third pointed out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He clearly knew it was a prostitution business, but he did not report it to the police. He should take legal responsibility,” said another.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0minnqegobJur9Slq66qlWTAsK%2FImqNmr5Whs6K%2BxGiYq6yZmLmme5JrbHBvaGd8pK3SnmSrnaaesrh50a6pmqRdmLWqusBmm6ibpKS%2FbrbAoqOenF2pv6at06KloGWjmsVuw86rop6qo2J%2FcX2RZqqpmaKgwG65xJ2gnJmcYrK1tMicqmaclZeutbGMrKacoZGh</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-momoa-says-he-still-considers-lisa-bonet-family-after-announcing-their-split.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Momoa Gives Update on Relationship with Lisa Bonet</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./windows-10-without-the-cruft-windows-10-ltsb-explained.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Windows 10 Without the Cruft: Windows 10 LTSB (Long Term Servicing Branch), Explained</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
