However, neither its main star Margot, nor Greta, received a nod. Both Ryan and Best Supporting Actress nominee America Ferrera have called out the decision. Neither Margot nor Greta have spoken out about their snubs yet.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1501791399-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-gosling-calls-out-the-oscars>Ryan Gosling calls out the Oscars</h2><p>In a statement, Ryan Gosling was clear in his stance when it came to his co-star and director not receiving Oscar nominations for their work. The 43-year-old stated: “There is no Ken without Barbie and there is no Barbie <a href=#>movie</a> without Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie.”</p><p>“I am extremely honored to be nominated by my colleagues alongside such remarkable artists in a year of so many great films,” the <a href=#>TV</a> star began. “And I never thought I’d being saying this, but I’m also incredibly honored and proud that it’s for portraying a plastic doll named Ken.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Emmys: Christina Applegate is emotional as she receives standing ovation</a></p><p>“But there is no Ken without Barbie, and there is no Barbie movie without Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, the two people most responsible for this history-making, globally celebrated film. No recognition would be possible for anyone on the film without their talent, grit, and genius.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> continued: “To say that I’m disappointed that they are not nominated in their respective categories would be an understatement.</p><p>“Against all odds with nothing but a couple of soulless, scantily clad, and thankfully crotchless dolls, they made us laugh, they broke our hearts, they pushed the culture and they made history. Their work should be recognized along with the other very deserving nominees.”</p><p>However, the singer of the film’s big <a href=#>music</a> number I’m Just Ken, which was nominated for Best Original Song (despite booing from the crowd during its announcement), concluded: “Having said that, I am so happy for America Ferrera and the other incredible artists who contributed their talents to making this such a groundbreaking film.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-america-ferrera-incredibly-disappointed-at-snubs>America Ferrera ‘incredibly disappointed’ at snubs</h2><p>Talking about her nomination from the <a href=#>awards show</a>, America, like Ryan Gosling, was “incredibly disappointed” at Margot and Greta’s lack of Oscar nominations. The Ugly Betty actress, who played the role of Gloria, a mom who helps Barbie on her real-world journey alongside her daughter Sasha, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Variety: “I still haven’t really been able to get in my feelings because I’m still on like the top layer of ‘I can’t even believe that this is real.”</p><p>She continued: “Greta has done just about everything that a director could do to deserve it. Creating this world, and taking something that didn’t have inherent value to most people and making it a global phenomenon. It feels disappointing to not see her on that list.</p><p>“What Margot achieved as an actress is truly unbelievable. One of the things about Margot as an actress is how easy she makes everything look. And perhaps people got fooled into thinking that the work seems easy, but Margot is a magician as an actress in front of the screen, and it was one of the honors of my career to get to witness her pull off the amazing performance she did.</p><p>“She brings so much heart and humor and depth and joy and fun to the character. In my book, she’s a master.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-say-lack-of-nominations-proves-the-point-of-barbie>Fans say lack of nominations ‘proves the point’ of Barbie</h2><p>People took to X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>) to express their upset as Ryan Gosling had at the lack of Oscar nominations for Greta and Margot.
