In spite of such, Gizelle’s fans, some of her co-stars, and even her own daughters have reservations about her relationship with Jamal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Gizelle-and-Jamal-Bryant.jpg><p id=par-2_35>It doesn’t make it easier as Jamal is always up against cheating rumors. In fact, the timeline of his reconciliation with Gizelle came into question as his last public relationship was with R&B singer Tweet.</p><h2><strong>Jamal Bryant and Tweet dated&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=par-3_16>Tweet and Jamal made their love public during a discussion on Jamal’s now-canceled talk show Preachers.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_71>“We’ve grown into an incredible friendship,” Jamal said in the couple’s first joint interview. “A year ago I was walking through Times Square going to an Oprah Winfrey movie premiere and I bumped into R&B Singer Tweet, who is my absolute favorite female singer in the world. And, I pulled an Orrick move and asked for a picture. We have grown into an incredible friendship; I call her my ‘Last Lady’.”</p><p id=par-5_39>During the interview, Tweet admitted the hardest part about dating Jamal was dealing with women vying for the pastor’s attention. At the time, Jamal was accused of fathering a 10-month old boy with a member of his church.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jamal-Bryant-and-Tweet.jpg><p id=par-6_32>The woman also accused him of not financially contributing to the child’s welfare. Tweet also said being with Jamal came with a certain level of responsibility that she was not used to.</p><p id=par-7_17>Within a year of going public, it appeared Tweet and Jamal split. It’s unclear what caused it.</p><p id=par-8_56>Jamal wasn’t Tweet’s first man in the pulpit. In fact, she told <a href=#>Hip Hollywood</a> in 2017 that her ex-husband, who is also the father of her daughter, is a minister. Despite the coincidence, Tweet says she does not seek out men who are active in leadership roles in the church. She is however a spiritual person.</p><p id=par-9_70>Tweet says the one lesson she learned from dating Jamal is to keep her romantic life private. “I’ve learned from the past to just keep my love interests private,” she said. “That was the first and last time. If you happen to see us [my new man] somewhere, I’m not hiding it, but it’s just not something I want the world to judge me on or have anything to say.”</p><h2><strong>Jamal Bryant is now reconciled with his ex-wife, Gizelle Bryant</strong></h2><p id=par-10_53>Tweet is opting to keep her new man out of the spotlight but Jamal doesn’t have the option as he’s reconciled with Gizelle, a reality star. During the season 4 reunion of RHOP, Gizelle confirmed that after over a decade of being divorced, she and Jamal are giving their love a second chance.</p><p id=par-11_44>Jamal has appeared on the show since season 1, typically in scenes with his three daughters. During season 5, Jamal and Gizelle had a few scenes solo. But Jamal is having trouble with dodging constant rumors about his philandering ways, including other children.</p><p id=par-12_26>Such was addressed at the season 5 reunion where Monique Samuels confronted Gizelle with a binder full of receipts allegedly proving Jamal’s relationship with another woman.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-13_18><strong>Related: ‘RHOP:’ </strong><a href=#><strong>Rumors Surface That Jamal Bryant Fathered Child With Another Woman After Rekindling Relationship With Gizelle Bryant</strong></a></p><p id=par-14_38>The Bryants are also under speculation regarding whether their reunion is just for the sake of the show, which they deny. Per Samuels, Jamal told his real girlfriend that he participated on the show to secure Gizelle’s position.</p><p id=par-15_40>With all of the backlash, Jamal revealed in a now-deleted Facebook video that he refuses to ever appear on RHOP again, despite his relationship with Gizelle. He cites reality television’s history of tearing down the Black community as his reason.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FqbvPZp6ispWhuaZ5wauwmqakqHqurc1moZqlkaF6o77YmqWtZaWosqV506hknZmkmnqiuoyrmWarmaO0pr6NoaumpF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./guide-to-nouveau-new-orleans.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Guide to Nouveau New Orleans</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brittany-favre.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brittany Favre Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
