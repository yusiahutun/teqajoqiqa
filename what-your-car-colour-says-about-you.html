They also appreciate control, but often take a reserved approach, avoiding any unnecessary drama. In 2020, black cars were officially the second most popular new car colour in the UK.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/502785c928a0-car-polestar-z.jpg><p id=eKsNAuRCByNBW data-wc=8><strong>The super stylish Polestar 2 is electric, too</strong></p><p id=edc79DIcKnWtk data-wc=60>The Polestar 2 is a stunning five-door hatchback from Volvo's new all-electric sister brand, new for 2021.

Those who fancy gold also love comfort and can’t resist a little glamour. However, gold cars are one of the least popular new car colour choices.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/987cac9b5285-bentley-z.jpg><p id=ed7WzJaopAurG data-wc=5><strong>The uber-luxe Bentley Flying Spur</strong></p><p id=eqrBVsQFOLO3- data-wc=44>If you've just won the lottery, then you'll probably splash out on a luxury car and the all-new Bentley Flying Spur is one of the best.

According to the latest official figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), white was the third most popular new car colour in the UK in 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/35d0d59dbc0b-car-white-z.jpg><p id=eTue4YF7DDgYv data-wc=13><strong>Looking chic in white, the new SEAT Leon is great value for money</strong></p><p id=eP8LRuvG_Uc-y data-wc=59>A new rival to the Ford Focus, Vauxhall Astra and Volkswagen Golf, the latest SEAT Leon offers good looks, value for money, space, loads of standard kit and sharp handling.
