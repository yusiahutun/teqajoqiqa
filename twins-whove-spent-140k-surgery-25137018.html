identical but you both have very different faces."</p><p>This led Daisy to confess her face was "a bit rounder", adding: "You can't change bone structure can you. But we try our best with what we can do."</p><p>Dolly added: "And when we go to the surgeon, we do ask for the same look and to try to get the same result."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25134682.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Booty-Builder-shows-off-results-of-her-workouts.jpg><p>The twins began their surgery journey with lip fillers at 18, with Daisy saying: "Straight away we did like how our lips looked when they were fuller and we did think, 'What else can we get next?'</p><p>"We realised it was quite easy to get things done."</p><p>They then had a nose job and a boob job together during the pandemic, with the pair deciding to have the procedure on the same day and with the same surgeon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25137061.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-195123.png><p>Daisy added: "Dolly has had a labiaplasty and I actually haven't yet."</p><p>Dolly continued: "Daisy is booked in but she hasn't been able to go yet because of Covid restrictions."</p><p>Phil seemed surprised by the suggestion as he asked them: "Why did you need to look alike?"</p><p>Daisy replied: "We don't need to look alike, it's just we both have that insecurity."</p><p>Meanwhile Dolly said the surgery was about "becoming their ideal selves", as Daisy continued: "We both didn't feel confident so getting things together, you get that support as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25087254.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_plastic_surgeryjpeg.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25087247.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_school_daysjpeg.jpg><p>Daisy however confessed she's a "bit more extreme" when it comes to her surgery though, added: "I do want a bit more done. I would get bigger boobs but she wants a BBL and stuff, I don't."</p><p>And being told the statistics that a Brazilian Butt Lift surgery can kill 1 in 3,000 people, Daisy said she was undeterred by the information.</p><p>She said: "It does put me off, and it does make me wary of getting the procedure but I think as long as you do your research on the surgeon and hopefully you'll be on good hands."</p><p>Meanwhile, their mother Christina told Phil and fellow presenter Holly Willoughby that she found their situation "very difficult".</p><p>She said: "I obviously believed they were beautiful before they had these procedures.</p><p>"I do believe there have been various things that have triggered this off. They got bullied at school because they were twins and dressed alike.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25087244.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Daisy_nowjpeg.jpg><p>"They didn't feel too good about themselves. Social media has a big impact."</p><p>She added: "When it came to going abroad, like Dolly did for her labiaplasty, I didn't agree with that.</p><p>"As a parent, you just want your children to be happy and healthy at the end of the day and they weren't happy before hand, and they are much happier now.</p><p>"But I do have concerns if they pursue further procedures. I've told them I don't want them to get BBL.</p><p>"I'm against that. It's like you said about the dangers of doing that. It's like, is it worth it? And at what point do you stop."</p><p>The twins revealed on the show that they've paid for the surgery using money from their nude OnlyFans content.</p><p>Christina admitted she found this challenging, adding: "This is very difficult for me to talk about because as a mother, I was aware when they were going to clubs and dancing.</p><p>"When Covid hit, it was difficult when all the clubs closed down and everything stopped.</p><p>"They were in rented accommodation and it was a case of, 'What do we do now'.</p><p>"They are very independent, they didn't want to move back home. The offer was on the table. it's totally new for me."</p><p>The mum-of-two also said she worries about trying to stop the surgeries from happening in case it damages her relationship with her daughters, adding: "I don't want to lose my daughters.</p><p>"I would do anything to keep them and look after them as well as I can. They are adults, they're 25-years-old, I cant literally stop them.</p><p>"I can try and advise and support. I am concerned for the twins but about young people in general."</p><p>The interview came after <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>the twins opened up to Daily Star about getting "creepy" messages from an old teacher after undergoing their surgery</a>.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25132588><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Ex-Playboy model admits she wants throuple with 'sexy' Prince Harry and Meghan" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25132588><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25087242.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Image1jpeg.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25132556.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/3_JS245636776_Banner.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25132588>Ex-Playboy model admits she wants throuple with 'sexy' Prince Harry and Meghan</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25133218><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="Outraged vegan woman accuses supermarket of 'tricking her' into eating meat" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25133218><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25137082.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-195323.png></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25133873.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_ede-as-coronavirus-stockpilers-rush-to-buy-toilet-paper_Main.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25133218>Outraged vegan woman accuses supermarket of 'tricking her' into eating meat</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKqVlrluuMifnGisp567tHnWoaavnV2ovaa602ZobWibYsC2vsaeqbJlYmp%2BdIOPam8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./surprising-household-items-help-plants-grow-garden.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Surprising Household Items That Can Help Plants Grow 10 Great Gardening Hacks</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./singapore-budget-focuses-relief-households-businesses-amid-rising-costs-we-have-your-backs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Singapores budget has something for everyone amid rising living costs.
