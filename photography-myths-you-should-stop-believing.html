However, being an excellent photographer has never been as accessible as it is today. Unsurprisingly, many people have felt empowered to hone their skills and express themselves through imagery.</p><p>When you look for photography advice online, you'll notice that you're bombarded with a lot of contradicting information. So, we thought that now would be a good time to put some of the biggest myths to bed.</p><h2 id=you-need-to-have-lots-of-lenses>1. You Need to Have Lots of Lenses</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nikon-lenses-and-camera-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A quick YouTube search will reveal countless videos about the best lenses for street photography, taking unique portraits, and so on. When you're just getting started and don't know what you want to specialize in, it's easy to think that you need one of each.</p><p>However, this is far from the case. Firstly, lenses are often expensive; adding to your kit is something you do over time. Secondly, your photos won't improve unless you know how to use your camera.</p><p>Whether you're <a href=#>buying your first prime lens</a> or adding a zoom lens to your collection, you probably need to experiment a little with a kit lens to see what you do and don't like. By doing that, you'll make a smarter decision when the time comes to upgrade.</p><h2 id=you-need-to-take-lots-of-lenses-out-with-you>2. You Need to Take Lots of Lenses Out With You</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/real-estate-photographer.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At some point, you'll probably encounter a camera bag with multiple compartments when searching for gear online. And on some occasions, you might notice your favorite YouTuber changing between one or more lenses while they're out on a shoot.</p><p>When you see these, it's easy to think that you have to take two, three, or even more lenses out with you every time you take pictures. But as anyone who's done this will testify, changing between lenses on your camera gets annoying—fast.</p><p>Another problem with taking a lot of lenses out on one shoot is that you'll constantly worry about focal length rather than getting the shot you want. Moreover, you could miss that perfect moment because you were too busy changing your lenses.</p><p>When you take photos, pick one lense that you think is the best for your goals on that shoot. If you don't get the picture you want because you didn't have another lens, learn from that and go out again some other time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=quot-the-camera-never-lies-quot>3.

If you've ever taken a picture you thought was jaw-dropping, only to find that it looks nowhere near as good on the camera, you'll know what we mean.</p><p>Your lens can also determine how your photo looks. For example, some focal lengths might make a person's face look wider or narrower.</p><p>The settings you use can determine how accurate a picture is, too. If your ISO is too low, for example, your image will look darker than the scene was in front of you. When out taking pictures, remember that you can manipulate your camera to get the results you want.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-need-a-good-camera>4.

Many people refuse to get started because they think what they've got is not good enough, meaning that the world misses out on seeing their art.</p><p>When you're at the start of your photography journey, the camera you have doesn't matter. Most smartphone cameras can take amazing shots, and you've always got one on you—so it makes sense to begin with that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Telling a story is just as important as the quality of your pictures. Start with your phone or the DSLR you've got in your garage, and slowly upgrade your gear when you know what you want. Consider looking at the <a href=#>iPhone camera settings you must master</a> for better results.</p><h2 id=your-gear-doesn-39-t-matter>5.

But if you want to take things further and make a career out of taking photos, your gear will become essential at some stage.</p><p>The pricier cameras and lenses cost more for a reason. They take clear pictures, give you more options, and make your job easier. Don't worry if you can't afford more expensive gear for now, though; start with what you've got and put together a long-term saving plan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=photography-isn-39-t-a-skill>6.

However, high-level photography is about much more than clicking a button on a camera; you need to understand lighting, composition, color theories, and much more.</p><p>To become a good photographer, it takes most people at least a few years. And to be the photographers you see selling fine art, it can take decades in some instances.</p><p>If you want to improve your photography faster, you can check out the numerous <a href=#>photography courses and guides</a> available on the web as a starting point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-can-fix-everything-on-your-computer>7.

Yes, you can change a lot, but your camera's settings when you take the picture will dictate just as much.</p><p>Let's say that you took a photo that's too dark. While you can increase the exposure, you might also add unwanted grain. Similarly, you can sharpen blurry images—but it's challenging to make it look like you originally intended when you pressed the button.</p><p>The more you get right when you take the photo, the easier it'll be to make tweaks in the post-production phase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-need-to-post-regularly-on-social-media-to-grow-as-a-photographer>8.

But if you don't use these platforms intentionally, they turn from tools to distractions. I've seen countless creators burn out from focusing too much on social media, and not enough on their actual craft.</p><p>You should use social media as an addition to what you're doing elsewhere. But if you don't want to have a presence on these platforms, consider the many other <a href=#>ways that artists can grow an audience without social media</a>. Blogging and starting a newsletter are two examples.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-must-use-manual-mode>9.

Manual Mode can be an excellent tool for taking better pictures. It's also a good idea to get out of Auto Mode and learn other aspects of your camera to maximize your photography toolkit. However, Manual Mode isn't necessary to take good photos.</p><p>Modern mirrorless and DSLR cameras have several settings that you can use to take better pictures. Personally, I use Aperture Priority more than almost every other setting. Why? Because someone who primarily photographs street scenes and cityscapes, I don't want to miss a good shot because I was messing around trying to get the correct settings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Try all the different modes on your camera to gain a better understanding of them.

This could have been due to impostor syndrome, and it might also have been because I had quite a narrow mind when it came to this particular craft.</p><p>Editing your photos isn't necessary, but it's a good idea to learn how to use Lightroom (or Capture One) and Photoshop if you want to <a href=#>hone your photography style</a>. What you see when you upload files on your computer—especially RAW files—isn't necessarily what you see when taking the picture. So, editing tools can help you fine tune numerous aspects and make corrections.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=plenty-of-photography-myths-are-worth-ignoring>Plenty of Photography Myths Are Worth Ignoring</h2><p>When you look from the outside in, it's easy to dismiss photography as nothing more than pointing a camera at something and hoping for the best.
