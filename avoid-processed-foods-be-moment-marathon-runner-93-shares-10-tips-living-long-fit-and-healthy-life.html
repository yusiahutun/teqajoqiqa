Don’t eat processed foods</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Allansmith avoids what she calls “c**p” – processed foods and sugar – which she believes does not help her body. Her “food bible” is Fast Carbs, Slow Carbs, by paediatrician, author, and former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr David Kessler.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The book describes the differences between, and the impact of, processed and unprocessed foods.

When I spend time outdoors, I’m focused on nature and other people and all the activity happening around me.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It gives me a sense of freedom because it helps me see that everything doesn’t all depend on me; everyone is working together to make things happen and that’s a positive thing.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Aerial yoga at 75, Pilates and diving too – he’s ageing well</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">3. Exercise regularly – and don’t make excuses to avoid it</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Allansmith started running when she was 45 years old. She was already going for regular walks when a colleague suggested she run two miles (3.2km) a day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I started with the 5K Turkey Trots (a popular American road race and a Thanksgiving tradition) and fun runs, and after a few years became hooked on marathons. I’ve continued to train and compete in races ever since,” she shares.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Allansmith currently runs and trains six days a week.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I never use my age, the weather, or anything else as an excuse to skip training,” she adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/28/799d0b5c-2ddb-4183-a408-0e3fda6ba716_50179315.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">4. Enjoy your chosen physical activity</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">You don’t have to take up running to stay fit for the rest of your life. Choose a heart-pumping activity that you love, because if you enjoy it enough, you’re more likely to do it regularly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Running and walking outside make me feel good, and that feeling keeps me happy for the rest of the day,” says Allansmith.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I started running in 1977, I fell in love with the feeling. It helped me appreciate the beauty of the early part of the morning, it was a chance for me to spend time outdoors – something I didn’t experience in my job.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It allowed me to meet and greet new people along the way as well as the freedom to go anywhere my feet could take me. Plus, there was always something new to see out on the road and I always felt so accomplished after a run.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">In Pretty Woman Julia Roberts says ‘bad stuff is easier to believe’.

Don’t dwell on the past or worry about the future</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Allansmith says that she is “absolutely” the sort of person who lives in the present, because “the present is all there is”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s essential to stay focused on today and to be in the moment. Ask yourself, ‘What can I do today?’. That’s how I work things out. Solutions are in the present, not in the past or the future.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/28/90069926-e69a-42a4-98f0-498d84a3d190_1126e908.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">6. Don’t let setbacks hold you back</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m used to setbacks and challenges since I’m 93!” Allansmith says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When she encounters a setback, she simply acknowledges it, thinks about what to do, does that, and moves on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“One example is when I broke a few toes and missed a marathon because of the injury. I couldn’t run for three months, so I switched things up by going to the gym and getting my heart rate up in different ways.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was so focused on continuing to train that I never even considered getting down about my broken toes. I just stayed focused on the work, and that gave me a sense of accomplishment and made me feel more optimistic.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">He shed 25kg by diet and exercise, in between beating cancer twice</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">7. Have a sense of humour</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Don’t let challenges disrupt your plans or throw your goals off track. Allansmith suggests finding the humour in them to help you overcome them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s important to me to laugh at the upsets that inevitably come my way and then quickly move on from them and get back to doing what I really enjoy – training and being on the road.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/28/368de31f-6f7b-4fa5-b834-2f7f236b1332_2b1c85de.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">8. Stay busy, curious and engaged</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Training takes up a lot of her day, but Allansmith still makes the effort to catch up with her friends and run errands.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In her spare time, she watches popular TV shows and “works hard to understand” her mobile phone and running watch.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I have many friends, both runners and non-runners, and I make it a point to reach out to them every week – maintaining connections is something I valueMathea Allansmith</figure><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">9. Be optimistic about tomorrow</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think that perpetual goal of the next race is important. I always know when my next race is because I would have already signed up for it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This creates a goal to work towards, and having that goal makes me think optimistically and positively about the training I’m doing in the present moment.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/28/85c4a8e8-d0c3-467b-998a-a5b8b0ca4517_9a97b1cd.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">10.
