Prior to joining the show, she recently shared in her new memoir <a href=#>Enough Already</a>, she learned from her parents of the death of an older brother under tragic circumstances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Valerie-Bertinelli-11.jpg><h2 id=h-valerie-bertinelli-s-older-brother-died-after-accidentally-swallowing-poison>Valerie Bertinelli’s older brother died after accidentally swallowing poison</h2><p id=par-2_25>The actor opened up in her recent book about a tragic time in her family’s life that she only learned about as a young teen.</p><p id=par-3_45>“While my mother was pregnant with me, my older brother Mark died after wandering unwatched into a friend’s barn and drinking poison out of a soda bottle. He was 17 months old,” she wrote, adding that she herself was born just months after his death.</p><p id=par-4_31>“I was literally born into grief,” she said. “My young parents were still trying to get through that horrendous experience. I believe that I absorbed their sense of loss and sadness.”</p><p id=par-5_39>While her parents didn’t hide their son’s death from Bertinelli or her three other brothers, “they didn’t talk about it, either. It was too painful for them. I didn’t learn about it until I was in my early teens.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>The actor didn’t visit her brother’s gravesite until she was a mother herself</h2><p id=par-6_29>It was when her grandmother had died and Bertinelli traveled to Delaware for her funeral that she did “finally see Mark’s grave. The two were buried near each other.”</p><p id=par-7_48>In her arms was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her then-toddler son, Wolfgang</a>, whom she affectionately refers to as “Wolfie.” As a young mother, she was able to relate to the intense pain her parents endured at the death of their son, much more than she had been able to as a teenager.</p><p id=par-8_76>“At the time, Wolfie was about the same age as Mark when he died,” she recalled. “I have always said that I couldn’t imagine the pain my parents went through after losing their child. However, I could imagine it. And I did. I remember tightening my grip on Wolfie as tears washed down my face. It was the first time that I grieved for my brother, and I began to understand my parents a little better.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Bertinelli said her brother’s death influenced the ‘role’ she played in her family</h2><p id=par-9_38>Being born so closely after such an awful moment in a family’s life, Bertinelli writes, placed her in the familial role as what she describes as pleaser to everyone. And it’s a revelation she’s only now understanding.</p><p id=par-10_44>Writing that she was aware of her parents’ deep love for her she added that, “still, before I was even born, there was a message sent to me that my role was to please others and bring enough happiness to fill a gaping hole.”</p><p id=par-11_69>It was a job, she sees now, that “could never be completed and that also missed the real point … I assumed a role that was never mine to fill … It took me until I was nearly 60 years old, but I finally understood that this feeling of trying to make up for my parents’ loss was as impossible as <a href=#>finding happiness in a number on the scale</a>.”</p><p id=par-12_9><strong>‘Enough Already’ is available now wherever books are sold.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTDorjEq6CeZZKav7W1zZ6jpaFdqK6qsIytnJ6mkZyys3nLnpirppWZerW%2BwKCgnGWUmq61tIyoo52domKvs7vToZyrZaOdsm66xK%2Bcq2WdmsFvtNOmo2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-kate-middletons-sister-pippa-middleton-ever-get-royal-title-of-her-own-find-out-1300976.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will Kate Middleton's Sister Pippa Middleton Ever Get Royal Title Of Her Own?
