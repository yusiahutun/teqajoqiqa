But if you've noticed your desire for sex has tanked, it could be time to adjust your workouts accordingly. Yep, there is a correlation between how often you exercise and how often you want to get it on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are many factors that influence someone's libido, and exercise is one of those factors," says sexologist Rebecca Alvarez, founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Bloomi</a>, a marketplace for sexual wellness products. Generally speaking, moderate movement is linked to increases in libido while excessive exercise is linked to libido lags. But why is that, exactly?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Below, we break down what your 'libido' actually refers to, and what can cause it to ebb and flow. Plus, experts offer insights on why exercise is one of those key influencers — and how adjusting your workout routine could lead to feeling hornier.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-high-and-low-libido-defined></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>High and Low Libido, Defined</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before we can explore what your workout routine is trying to tell you about your libido, let's get clear on what the term refers to. At its most distilled, libido refers to a person's general interest in sex, explains Alvarez. Synonymous with terms like 'sex drive' and 'sexual appetite', it's someone's baseline over the course of weeks, months, and years, rather than their arousal in a specific moment, she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While libido is generally described in terms like 'high' or 'low', there are no qualitative terms to measure it. Unlike metrics like resting heart rate and blood pressure, which have numerical ranges that are generally considered high or low for the entire population, libido does not.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The measures of libido are highly subjective for every sex-haver, says Alvarez. For example, desiring sex once a week may feel high to one person, but low to another. So, if someone tells you they have a 'high libido' or 'low libido' you'll need to ask follow up questions like, "What does that mean to you?" or "Wait, so in your dream world how often would you have sex?" to actually know what they mean.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's important to know that whether someone has a high libido or low libido or somewhere in between, whatever that means to them, that is normal," says holistic health expert Ana Gonzalez Herrera, founder and CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Hormone University</a>, an educational platform about hormones. The only potentially abnormal libido is the one that drastically changed seemingly out of nowhere. But more on this below...</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-controls-your-libido-exactly></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Controls Your Libido, Exactly?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So many things! "Your libido is influenced by a combination of psychological, physiological, and emotional factors," says Herrera. That includes things like your stress levels, mental well-being, hormone levels (and fluctuations), medications, and overall health (and health changes).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your libido is also hugely affected by general lifestyle choices (sleep! food! alcohol! drugs!), and if you're partnered, could also be affected by your general happiness in your relationship, or uh, situationship. As she puts it, it's unlikely that you'll desire sex with a partner you're fighting with, or you haven't historically had pleasurable sex with. That checks!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-relationship-between-libido-and-exercise></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Relationship Between Libido and Exercise</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your exercise routine — or lack thereof — is one of the main factors influencing your libido. In short, that's because your exercise routine has the power to influence your stress levels, overall mental health, sense of self, and lifestyle choices, says physical therapist Grayson Wickham, D.P.T., C.S.C.S., founder of digital movement platform <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Movement Vault</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Generally speaking, most people notice decreased stress, improved mental well-being, and increased confidence, as well as make better lifestyle choices when they have a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>regular exercise routine</a>. As such, a regular movement practice is usually linked to a greater interest in sex, says Alvarez — a connection that research has supported <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>time</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>time</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>time</a> again, by the way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Physiological factors aside, Herrera notes that exercise can also positively influence the hormones that impact someone's interest in sex. "Moderate exercise has been shown to boost testosterone levels in men and women," she says. Given that testosterone is dubbed the 'sex hormone', it should (ahem) come as no surprise that a rise in testosterone is linked with a rise in libido. Indeed, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>research</a> has shown that those who exercise have higher testosterone levels compared to those who are sedentary.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And in case you were wondering: Both <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>resistance training</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>endurance training</a> have been shown to have this effect. So whether you're a cardio bunny or weight room warrior, your libido will reap the reward.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-but-exercising-too-much-can-have-the-opposite-effect></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>...But Exercising Too Much Can Have the Opposite Effect</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The problem is, as far as your libido is concerned, when it comes to exercise more actually isn't better since you can send your body into a state of over-training, according to Wickham.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Overtraining syndrome is caused by a combination of too much exercise and not enough recovery," he explains. And it can lead to a number of unsavory side effects such as prolonged fatigue, moodiness, feelings of stress and agitation, loss of appetite, poor sleep quality, and lingering injury and soreness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As you might guess, it's pretty tough to want to roll around in the hay or power up your vibe when you're feeling any of these symptoms — and generalized fatigue is an especially brutal libido killer. "It's difficult to either desire or have sex if you're exhausted," says Herrera. True.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, it's an actual evolutionary response to prioritize fitness recovery over reproduction (read: sex). "The body goes into recovery mode after strenuous workouts in order to repair your muscles," she explains. "This means that your body is prioritizing its efforts on creating an anti-inflammatory response, and not on the idea of getting sex." In other words, following a workout, muscle repair trumps making love, as far as your body is concerned.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">More extreme instances of overtraining can even cause hormonal disarray. Train too hard and your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>cortisol levels</a> (that's the stress hormone) can climb and climb and climb, explains Herrera. Because the entire endocrine (hormone) system is interconnected, when your cortisol levels go up, it can cause your other hormones (including the sex hormone!) to dip, she explains. The result: You're less horny!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Wickham, most of the general population doesn't have to worry about inching into over-training territory — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>research</a> suggests endurance athletes, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>elite runners</a>, and high-level athletes are especially susceptible. That said, even if you're <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>new to exercise</a> it's important to pay extra attention to your body for any signs and symptoms of overtraining — including your sex drive.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-this-means-for-you></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What This Means For You</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Changes in how often you want sex can be a sign that something is up with your body — basically, it's your body's check engine light — so don't just brush them aside.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're noticing that your libido is lower or higher than you want it — and especially newly so —you should talk to your healthcare provider, rather than self-prescribing more or less exercise, says ob-gyn Lyndsey Harper, M.D., founder and CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rosy</a>, a sexual health wellness technology platform. They'll be able to run some underlying tests to discern what's going on, if anything. They'll also help you understand if any of the medications you're on may be the cause, she says. (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Birth control</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>antidepressants</a>, for example, are known to have libido-squashing effects).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even if your libido isn't the reason you're re-thinking your exercise routine, chatting to your provider before making any edits to your exercise routine is always a good move, generally speaking, because factors like your age, pre-existing health conditions, and medications all influence how much exercise your body can (and should!) handle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the meantime, if you're a person who hits the Peloton, trail, or box on the reg, consider re-prioritizing your recovery. According to Wickham, doing stress relief work, consuming quality foods, and incorporating recovery protocols like sauna sitting, foam rolling, and self-massaging all support the body and your libido, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWmrcutn2aemam7pr%2FSaKOimpmZvG6%2FxLFknaqZq7Juw86roqitpGK%2FsMHToqWe</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mothers-day-messages.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>50 Mother's Day Messages for Friends and Family 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-hairstyle-movies-movie-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 30 Best Hairstyles in Movie History</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
