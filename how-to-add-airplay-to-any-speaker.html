Products like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Belkin SoundForm</a>, <a href=#>WiiM Pro</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">WiiM Mini</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eve Play</a> connect to any audio amplifier, receiver, or active "powered" speakers to deliver AirPlay 2 functionality.</p><p>These adapters are easy to set up and will immediately appear in the AirPlay list on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch. They can also be triggered through Siri voice commands or smart home automation (you might create an automation that plays your favorite playlist every evening, for example). And if you own multiple AirPlay devices, you can sync them with your AirPlay adapter for wireless whole-home audio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>AirPlay adapters are compatible with the following devices:</p><ul><li>Stereo amplifiers, stereo receivers, and AVRs</li><li>Active "powered" speakers</li><li>Soundbars or radios with an optical, RCA, coaxial, or AUX input</li><li>Bluetooth speakers with an AUX input</li><li>DVD or Blu-ray.</li></ul><p>Most AirPlay adapters have RCA, coaxial, and optical audio outputs, so an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">RCA to 1/4"</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">RCA to AUX</a> cable may be required if you're connecting the adapter to a soundbar, a Bluetooth speaker, or a pair of powered speakers. (That said, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Belkin SoundForm</a> has a 1/4" TRS stereo jack, and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">WiiM Mini</a> has a 3.5mm AUX output.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're trying to add AirPlay to a set of passive speakers (which do not receive power from a wall outlet), you'll need a stereo amplifier or receiver to pair with the AirPlay adapter. The cheapest stereo amplifiers cost about $25 (like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Kinter MA170+</a>) and are, in my experience, perfectly acceptable. But a nice amplifier with multiple audio inputs, USB playback, AM and FM radio, and other features (like those from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Pyle</a>) will cost $100 or more. You can also find great bargains on amplifiers at thrift stores and flea markets. That said, if you're willing to spend some serious money, you could buy an AVR or amplifier with AirPlay built-in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wiim-pro-receiver-on-a-white-background.png><h5 class=display-card-title>WiiM Pro</h5><p class=display-card-description>The WiiM Pro adds AirPlay and Bluetooth functionality to any amplifier or powered speaker through RCA, optical, and coaxial audio outputs.

An AVR or stereo amp with built-in AirPlay eliminates the need for an external adapter, and it may be the best option for those who are already planning on upgrading the brains of their audio system.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the name implies, an AVR or "Audio/Video Receiver" connects your TV and speakers to multiple video and audio sources. These connections are facilitated over several HDMI, RCA, optical, and phono ports (plus AM and FM antennae, and in this case, wireless AirPlay connectivity). You can connect any old passive speakers to an AVR, and because audio can be configured on a per-input basis, you can select special settings for video or music playback. (AirPlay streaming doesn't support Dolby Atmos, so your AirPlay input will be limited to stereo audio.)</p><p>Only a handful of AVRs include AirPlay functionality. One of the more fully-featured options is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Onkyo's 7.2-channel AVR</a>, which has a wealth of dedicated audio inputs in addition to Wi-Fi streaming (AirPlay, Spotify Connect, Chromecast) and Bluetooth connectivity. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Yamaha RX-V4A 5.2-channel AVR</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Denon S570BT 5.2-channel AVR</a> are a bit more modest, but they're also more affordable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you don't need a big home theater system, a stereo amplifier with AirPlay functionality is your best option. It'll provide a more immediate music experience with far less setup or configuration. There's just one problem—the only notable stereo amplifier with AirPlay is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Sonos Amp</a>, which costs more than any of the AVRs listed above. Sonos Amp is a fantastic product, and it can integrate with other Sonos devices to create a wireless whole-home audio system. But it's a very expensive AirPlay solution, and if you already own an amplifier, you're probably better off with an AirPlay adapter.</p><p>Please note that AVRs and stereo amplifiers are made for passive speakers. If you own active speakers that receive power from a wall outlet, you must buy an AVR or amplifier with stereo pre-out jacks (or buy an AirPlay adapter instead). The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Onkyo 7.2-channel AVR</a> has stereo pre-out jacks, but the other devices listed in this section do not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/6-1.png><h5 class=display-card-title>Onkyo TX 7.2-Channel AVR</h5>$349 <span class=regular-price>$649</span> Save $300<p class=display-card-description>The Onkyo TX 7.2-channel AVR (TX-NR696) offers Dolby Atmos compatibility, a wide input selection, 4K video output, and advanced Wi-Fi audio streaming capabilities.

Simply buy an Apple TV or Roku device and plug it into your AVR, soundbar, or TV. All current-gen models of Apple TV and Roku include AirPlay 2 functionality and will appear in the AirPlay list on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch. (Of course, this will also add AirPlay video casting and screen mirroring functionality to your TV or home theater.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for which Apple TV or Roku device you should buy—well, let's clarify something first. AirPlay streaming maxes out at 16-bit/44.1kHz "CD quality" and doesn't support Dolby Atmos. A $30 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Roku Express</a> will give you the same AirPlay audio quality as a $150 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Apple TV 4K</a>. If AirPlay audio is the only thing you care about, the cheap Roku is fine, though Apple TV is notable for its deep <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HomeKit and Siri integration</a>.</p><p>That said, you'll probably use your Apple TV or Roku for more than just AirPlay audio. Look at all available models and buy one that has the features you care about, such as 4K video resolution or Dolby Atmos audio. Note that smart TVs from Sony, Samsung, LG, and VIZIO often include AirPlay functionality. Smart TVs that use Roku's operating system may also support AirPlay, though this isn't always guaranteed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/41dweokt5fl-_sl160_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Roku Express</h5>$20 <span class=regular-price>$30</span> Save $10<p class=display-card-description>The affordable Roku Express streams 1080p video and includes AirPlay functionality.

But the quickest, easiest, and most popular option is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shareport Sync</a>. It has some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">minor limitations</a>—you can't cast from the Windows iTunes app or macOS versions prior to Catalina 10.15, for example.
