It's a website that specializes in pictures of English-language mishaps, often in foreign lands.</p><p>Let's be clear, there is absolutely no shame in making errors when English is not your mother tongue. This funny website typically focuses on errors committed by businesses—and there really is no excuse for them.</p><p>If you're struggling to learn English, there are <a href=#>apps that help you build English vocabulary and learn how to use those words</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=funny-short-jokes>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Funny Short Jokes</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/funny-short-jokes.jpg><p>If you're short of time and need a quick joke to lighten your mood before you head out for the day, head to Funny Short Jokes. It is one of the funniest sites on the web if you are into one-liners.</p><p>Unfortunately, only a couple of new jokes are added every month, but there is a massive back catalog you can dig into. Jokes also have a Reddit-esque upvote/downvote system, so you can quickly find which quips other readers enjoyed.</p><h2 id=the-onion>3. <a href=# title="The Onion">The Onion</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/the-onion.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If satire is more to your liking, you'll certainly have heard about The Onion.

Comedian and actor Bob Odenkirk has gone on record as saying, "[The Onion] is the best comedy writing in the country, and it has been since it started."</p><p>If you don't feel like reading, you can watch its funny videos for a quick laugh.</p><h2 id=overheard-in-new-york>4. <a href=# title="Overheard in New York">Overheard in New York</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/nyc.png><p>Overheard in New York lets residents of the city submit snippets of conversations they hear while going about their daily lives in the Big Apple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has become so popular that a number of sister sites have been spawned (such as Overheard in the Office and Overheard at the Beach), and a book of the most popular quotes has been published.</p><h2 id=cyanide-and-happiness>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyanide and Happiness</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cyanide-and-happiness.jpg><p>Cyanide and Happiness is one of the most well-known webcomics on the internet.
