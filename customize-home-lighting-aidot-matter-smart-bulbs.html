Any smart-home device, such as lights, outlets, cameras, sensors, or household appliances that have “Works With AiDot” functionality can join your home’s AiDot ecosystem in the app.</p><p>The Works With AiDot ecosystem includes well-known smart-device brands such as Linkind, OREiN, Winees, WELOV, Syvio, GoGonova, Ganiza, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aidot-matter-protocol.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aidot-supports-the-matter-protocol>AiDot Supports the Matter Protocol</h2><p>New for 2023, AiDot announced that its new app and many of its upcoming smart devices will be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Matter-compatible</a>. The Matter Protocol (formerly known as Project CHIP) is a new standard from the Connectivity Standards Alliance that will help developers create smart devices that work with one another regardless of the brand and with Matter-enabled smart-home platforms, like AiDot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/orein-light-bulbs.jpg><p>In addition to supporting the Matter Protocol with its app, AiDot now offers a Matter lineup of smart bulbs created by OREiN and Linkind. The AiDot Matter Smart Bulbs have exclusive features that enhance your experience and capitalize on the opportunity for customization.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aidot-logo.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>AiDot</h5><p class=display-card-description>With&nbsp;AiDot, you can establish an internal smart home that gives you a new IoT lifestyle and make your life smarter, easier, and cozier.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at AiDot</a> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=discover-the-linkind-and-orein-matter-smart-bulbs-from-aidot>Discover the Linkind and OREiN Matter Smart Bulbs From AiDot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/orien-bulb-no-color.jpg><p>AiDot’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Linkind Matter A19 Smart Bulbs</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">OREiN A19 Smart Bulbs</a> work seamlessly with Matter-compatible platforms, such as the AiDot app, while enhancing privacy and security without relying on cloud services. They have also been certified by WWAH (Works with Apple Home) and WWGH (Works with Google Home).</p><p>When added to your AiDot ecosystem, these bulbs can be easily controlled with voice commands: “Alexa, make the dining room lights blue.” Bulbs can even be grouped and controlled together for additional ease of use.</p><h3 id=get-creative-with-colors>Get Creative With Colors</h3><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyond streamlined compatibility, AiDot smart bulbs have incredibly diverse functionality. When it comes to color, you can choose from millions of options, including your exact desired type of white lighting, from warm (1800K) to cool (6500K), a larger range than other typical smart bulbs.</p><p>AiDot smart bulbs have 9W brightness, which is equivalent to 60W incandescent bulbs, and boast energy-consumption savings of up to 85%, all without losing brightness or color quality, with an impressive color rendering index (CRI) of 90+, whereas other brands typically max out at 80CRI.</p><p>Selecting a color to match the mood can be a fun game whether you’re alone reading a book or settling in with your partner for some TV binge-watching.</p><h3 id=amazing-durability>Amazing Durability</h3><p>Once you buy Matter smart bulbs, you won’t need to change them for literal decades. With an average daily use of three hours, AiDot Matter smart bulbs have an estimated lifespan of approximately 22 years, the equivalent of roughly 25,000 hours.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=interactive-music-modes>Interactive Music Modes</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><p>One of the best features to play around with is the various music modes. You can create a dance floor where the colors and lighting effects move with the music. By choosing Party, Dynamic, Calm, or Auto Rhythm in the AiDot app, you can make your bulbs dance, crafting a mood that matches the tunes. You can fully customize your lighting experience by adjusting the speed, colors, and brightness to your liking.</p><p>If you want a hands-off completely immersive experience, the exclusive-to-AiDot Synchronous Music Rhythm mode will match the smart bulb’s lighting exactly with the rhythm and beat of the music. Imagine a listening party when your favorite artist drops their new album, you and your friends can enjoy the songs while the Matter smart bulbs create the perfect atmosphere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/orien-bulbs-music-reactive.jpg><p>For a more unexpected and creative visual experience, Asynchronous Music Rhythm mode, also exclusive to AiDot, will create more artistic interactions between the beat and the lights. This mode is less predictable, allowing the lights to move outside the rhythm of the music.</p><h3 id=personalized-lighting-scenes>Personalized Lighting Scenes</h3><p>In Wake-Up mode, your Matter smart bulb can slowly simulate the sunrise, gently rousing you from your night’s rest as the bulb’s colors gradually shift from darkness to dawn. You can say goodbye to waking up from a jarring alarm clock sound and enjoy waking up naturally from simulated sunlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similarly, you can set your smart bulbs to change color at certain times of day, which can act as a reminder that bedtime is around the corner, or it’s time to take a rest. These features can be especially helpful for anyone taking care of seniors or children.</p><h3 id=easy-operation-from-anywhere>Easy Operation From Anywhere</h3><p>Everything you want to do with your AiDot Matter Smart Bulbs can be done from your smartphone, no matter where you are.
