I couldn’t let him know how I felt about him enough. But I hope that he saw it every time I picked up a pair of sticks and I went to drum. He meant that much to me, and he will continue to mean that much to me as a friend. That’s an amazing force.”</p><p>He continued by telling the crowd how he “will have him in my mind no matter when I’m playing,” and was thankful to have been introduced to the drummer by music director Valdez Brantle.</p><p>“I will always love Aaron Spears. I will have him in my mind no matter when I’m playing, where I’m playing – I always hear his rolls.” Usher then added: “You cold, bro!

I love you for making certain that you kept us together. And no matter where we were, no matter what was going on, that man would always just call.&nbsp;</p><p>“He would encourage me. He would say, ‘Man, you’re gonna be alright.’ He would say, ‘Tonight is gonna be the most incredible night ever!’ The opening night, he not even playing on the stage. I’m like, ‘Man, Aaron, you are just God-sent, man.’</p><p>The U Got It Bad singer ended his speech by reminding people to be appreciative of their loved ones: “I honor this man. I praise him for the person he is to each and every person in this room, because we recognize and we acknowledge him.”</p><p>Usher then said: “And I tell you, as you leave, appreciate the ones that you have while you have them.
