As Portia entered the room in her gown, holding white roses, DeGeneres was clearly taken aback by what was going on.</p><p>Expressing shock and exclaiming, "Oh my god!", Ellen then joined her wife in front of the whole party -- as Kris Jenner stepped in to officiate the ceremony.</p><p>"Welcome to Portia's birthday party and to the newest home of one of my favorite couples, two of my BFs and the record holders for the most homes every purchased in one city," joked Jenner. "These two were born for each other ... these two are couple goals who continue to amaze me with how cute they are together, a match made in heaven."</p><p>"Two peas in a pod, their love and commitment to each other is amazing and it makes me so happy that they have each other to love and cherish and grow old with," she added. "Today Portia would like us to witness a renewal of her commitment to Ellen, to honor and celebrate their marriage of 14 years."</p><p>With that, Jenner passed over the mic to de Rossi, who exclaimed "Surprise!" to her very surprised wife.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e92fa51b-bbe8-450a-8718-ac4787dd8e31 data-container-ref=toofab:article:19f283b7-c48e-48a6-8bd2-1617fd9fa1d3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/41/5by4/2022/12/23/4109ed18a5394fb4a15ca9907ae99390_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram / Warner Bros.</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ellen DeGeneres Says tWitch Was 'Pure Light' In Emotional Video Tribute</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"You don't have to say anything at all, but when I was thinking about what would make my birthday really special, it was reminding you that you're the most important thing in the world to me, in front of family and friends," she said.</p><p>"I was thinking about my life, my accomplishments, and it just all kept leading back to you and I thought what greater accomplishment could I ever ever have in my life than being loved by someone who is so magnificent, by someone as incredible as you," she continued.

"You cheer me up when I'm down, you make me feel seen, you make me feel safe, cherished, loved. I love you, I will always love you. I am so honored to be your life."</p><p>After they kissed, DeGeneres was nearly at a loss for words.</p><p>"I just adore you, I love you and I would not be on this earth without you," she said to Portia. "You save me every day. Thank you for saving me every day. I'm the lucky one. Wow, everybody!"</p><p>Sharing video of the whole thing to Instagram, Ellen added, "Portia surprised me at her birthday party by renewing our vows.
