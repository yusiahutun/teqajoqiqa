Because of it, we cannot detect where and how she got to the present situation that she is in today.</p><p>Likewise, Elena began her career as a professional news reporter while attending her bachelor’s degree. But, Elena was mostly known as a model at that time. During her time as a model, the 5 feet 8 Inches model graced the cover of many high fashion magazines. Not to mention, the model walked in numerous runways.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Snooki Net Worth, Salary, Career, Jersey Shore, Husband, Kids, Wiki-Bio >></i></a></h4><p>In addition, Elena later worked as a photo editor for Maxim Russia.

Gregory, also known as Greg, was rumored to be gay before his relationship with Elena.

So, how did these two meet? One from fashion and another as a TV personality? Well, we will shed some light on it.</p><p>The famous blogger and entrepreneur both met during their work in Maxim Magazine, UK. Surprisingly, Greg deliberately wrote an article about Elena to attract her attention. It seems before they even met, Gutfeld knew about Elena. No, to be precise, he was one of her fans and admirers.</p><p>But getting noticed amidst the thousands of fans was not a small task. Considering Elena’s popularity, the thought itself was herculean. However, this is Greg we are talking about. Following the event, Gutfelf wrote an article about her. Moreover, the TV presenter took time illustrating her black hair and brown eyes.</p><p>To sum up, he tried hard to impress Elena. And&nbsp;lucky enough, his plan worked. Being noticed by his muse was sure satisfying. While being written an article about her by the famous author and TV personality was an honor for Moussa as well. This led the two to be familiar with each other, and it did not take much for the feelings to grow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/elena-2.png><p>After dating for a long time, the couple tied the knots in 2003 in the presence of their family and close friends. In the first place, the model only got fame after she married her husband, Greg Gutfeld.</p><p>Despite being overly successful and famous, Elena is very humble and down to earth. In fact, it seems like Greg is the one shielding Elena from the public eye. Also, He rarely mentions Elena in his interviews. Nonetheless, Elena is active in her social media accounts. Her one means of contact with the chaotic world outside.</p><p>In fact, the public gets most of her news through them.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ford Vs.

However, the couple is happily married and is now enjoying a blissful life in each other’s company. Moreover, after marrying Elena, Greg’s image as a Gay also disappeared.</p><p>Similarly, after their marriage, Elena retired from the modeling industry and stopped appearing in cover magazines.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Although Elena likes to keep a low profile in the media, the now-retired model is relatively active in social media.
