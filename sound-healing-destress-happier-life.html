It involves lying in a cosy, atmospheric room, while sounds from gongs and crystal bowls wash over you.</p><p id=eTw8ABw9F9b data-wc=25>All you have to do is lie there. Post-session, you'll float out of the room feeling ridiculously relaxed – and sometimes a bit spaced out.</p><p id=e7LHiBpoU2 data-wc=20><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>A life coach shares the simple habit that helps her stop overthinking - and we can all try it</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eN89t1LkWen data-wc=34>I'm often surprised by how intense the sounds are in a healing session, feeling like the noises are taking over the whole space. Clare explains this overpowering sense is due to the vibrations created.</p><p id=ehf609R3FDS data-wc=23>"Bowls and gongs are particularly resonant instruments, meaning that no microphones or amplification equipment is needed for the sounds to fill the room.</p><p id=eLS_89qX9ik data-wc=20>"By simply playing the instruments themselves, we are able to produce vibrations powerful enough to fill the room," she adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/314431ce5ed4-third-space-sound-bath-21.jpg><h2><strong>What are the benefits of sound healing?</strong></h2><p id=egvBpGl7ryhS data-wc=45>If you're struggling with stress and anxiety, sound healing may be able to help, Clare says. "Sound healing allows us to tap into the parasympathetic nervous system in a way that requires minimal conscious effort from the individual, whilst still bringing about great stress-relieving rewards."</p><p id=ewBWBxjnL3VE data-wc=62>The main benefit that you’re likely to experience from sound healing is deep relaxation. "The sound vibrations help you to slow down the activity of the mind and drop into Theta brainwaves, which are the brainwaves we drop into during meditation and just before sleep. It’s when we’re in this state that we can access deep mental and physical relaxation," Clare says.</p><p id=eDdCsZnC9R data-wc=11><strong>RELAX:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The 20-minute ritual that switched off my busy brain instantly</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ezo6sOw5ZEs_ data-wc=19>"Sound healing can also help to boost creativity and learning, reduce anxiety and stress, and strengthen your immune system.</p><p id=eMvvgIBt4-Lq data-wc=31>During your sound healing session, the nervous system is downregulated, meaning we shift from a sympathetic state, commonly referred to as fight or flight, to a parasympathetic state, the relaxation response.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a783d8178a48-thirdspacemoorgatemindbody-1.jpg><p id=evIYLwGYw38R data-wc=19>"As this occurs, the heart rate slows, blood pressure reduces and the release of the stress hormone cortisol slows."</p><p id=eFsluyj179xA data-wc=29>It's not just the sound itself that helps, though. During the sessions, nasal breathing and humming are sometimes included, which increase the release of nitric oxide into the bloodstream.&nbsp;</p><p id=egw3w65NsJKM data-wc=36>"This helps improve blood flow, lower blood pressure and stress, oxygenate cells and allows for better utilisation of the oxygen being inhaled. Together, this can help to reduce fatigue and strengthen the immune system," Clare says.</p><p id=ei0stm6Qxlp9 data-wc=43>The more nitric oxide you secrete, the easier it is to get into a parasympathetic state. The more often you get into a parasympathetic state, the easier it is to stay there meaning your natural state will be calmer and happier, she adds.</p><h2><strong>How does sound healing work?</strong></h2><p id=etxFDBSs_I5k data-wc=34>It sounds too good to be true, that simply lying down and listening to soothing sounds can help us to relax, but Clare explains that there's a complex reason it helps us to de-stress.</p><p id=ebmRRdjTi10b data-wc=22>"The instruments played during sound healing are tuned to different vibrational frequencies which have different impacts on the body and the mind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a6d5ea4aae5c-third-space-sound-bath-20.jpg><p id=e41o2om1lSIE data-wc=55>"It is said that emotions have different vibrational frequencies – emotions that we consider uncomfortable or unpleasant are said to vibrate at lower frequencies and joyful emotions at higher frequencies. Through sound healing, we can encourage the body to start to vibrate at a higher frequency, creating better conditions for more positive emotions to occur.</p><p id=eMWMXijn9hRr data-wc=62>"Of all the senses, sound has the biggest impact on the brain, stimulating the slowing down of our brain waves from Beta to Theta which allows us to down-regulate the nervous system and find a state of relaxation. Sound stimulates both sides of the brain at the same time which may allow weaker neuronal pathways to develop, improving communication between the hemispheres."</p><h2><strong>How long will I feel calm after sound healing?</strong></h2><p id=eLr78_2wLoTi data-wc=30>The effects of sound healing differ from person to person, says Clare. "For some, it might last for hours, whilst for others this could stretch into the next few days.</p><p id=eiZC1u7Y4gSB data-wc=31>"The more often you practice sound healing, the easier it is to reach, and stay within, the parasympathetic state, meaning that you are likely to notice the beneficial effects for longer."</p><h2><strong>How often do I need to go to sound healing sessions?</strong></h2><p id=eS5YkkDmWGg0 data-wc=35>I tend to only book into sound healing when I'm feeling particularly anxious, as an antidote to stress, but I wondered if it was something I should be doing weekly, like yoga or weight training.</p><p id=e8OGKVf9ruN2 data-wc=53>Clare explains that my approach is the one they recommend, though. "We’d advise each person to work with as much as feels good for their mind and body, in balance with a well-rounded fitness routine. This might be once a month, perhaps once a week or maybe even more if your schedule allows."</p><p id=eBsBH4GSHEC1 data-wc=18><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Find out more about Third Space's Sound Healing sessions&nbsp;</a></p><p id=e7DaSzY223qA data-wc=11><strong>&nbsp;<span style=font-family:Montserrat,sans-serif;font-size:15px;background-color:initial;box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:bolder>&nbsp;</span><a class=hm-link href=#>For more inspiration on how to relax, visit HELLO!'s Happiness Hub</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
