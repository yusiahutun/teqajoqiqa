It emphasizes the risk associated with fully opening up to someone and the potential for feeling foolish or exposed. This theme highlights the importance of trust and the subsequent fear of being hurt or betrayed.Furthermore, the lyric, "Oh, there is something I see in you, it might kill me, I want it to be true," explores the theme of attraction to the unknown and the desire to uncover deeper layers of a person's character.
