No longer restricted to grunge biker styles or trench coats, today, you can get a leather jacket in pretty much every shape and color — real or faux. So, whether you’re looking to channel Blondie and Joan Jett or a more feminine look as seen on Jennifer Lopez and Vanessa Hudgens, there’s a leather jacket out there that will fit your vibe.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help you find the perfect one for what you have in mind, we sought the advice of style experts and scrolled countless retailers, read the reviews, and finally, landed on our favorites, which you can discover below.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-levis-vegan-leather-moto-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi's Vegan Leather Moto Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levis Vegan Leather Moto Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MxmczaqJRK7HRMX-8GFwwQq-jZ0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/levis-vegan-leather-moto-jacket-929b253464934b9c9631916076ae1715.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Levi's</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you think “leather jacket”, this style is probably the first thing that pops to mind. Add in a cruelty-free factor and you’ve got a vegan leather moto jacket from Levi’s. The minimalist, sleek jacket has all the classic features of a biker jacket: a spread collar, snap-down lapels, asymmetrical zip, and half zips up the sleeves. The leather itself has a lightly roughed-up texture to it, which gives it a more realistic appeal. Aside from that, there are no extra frills, details, or embroideries that would make it appeal to only a certain group of people. It’s a universal leather jacket if you will. It does sit close to your body, so it may be difficult to fit in thick layers underneath. But feel free to grab this jacket whenever you’re running out of the house in your dress, jeans, or skirt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> +10 | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyurethane, polyester | <strong>Fit:</strong> Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-quince-100-leather-motorcycle-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Quince Motorcycle Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Quince 100% Leather Motorcycle Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kDXpGghZdY7Ro8rh2B4Aa6AaLYI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/quince-100-leather-motorcycle-jacket-285819e13a7f4c0e87c50ec6cef1d0a7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Quince</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What’s deemed as a “low price” can mean different things to different people, but we think we can all agree that a genuine leather jacket for $150 is quite the steal — which is why we’re so drawn to this piece from Quince! Coming in a classic racer jacket style in four colors, the top-grain leather is high-quality and will be in your closet for years to come. “The long-established motorcycle design has always been one of my favorites and is forever timeless,” stylist and designer Jonathan Marc Stein tells InStyle. “This one hits every mark from design to quality. Perfect for any outfit, you can pair it with a T-shirt and jeans or wear over any outfit for style and comfort.” We think this jacket is worth the money, however, if you’re not big on smells, be warned as reviewers have mentioned it has quite a strong, plastic-like aroma that goes away with wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Material:</strong> 100% top grain sheep leather, poly satin | <strong>Fit:</strong> Slim</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-faux-zara-faux-leather-biker-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Faux</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Zara Faux Leather Biker Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=3072 data-sizes=750px alt="Faux Leather Biker Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uf8MVZWbtxacMpFD5RqPVWHrX5M=/fit-in/1500x3072/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/3046060800_1_1_1-1b8354c44b3f4ea6baf5123e2094fd3b.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I love a biker jacket as it's a perennial piece that always looks cool” says style editor Carmen Bellot. You can always count on Zara for well-crafted wardrobe classics, and this faux leather biker jacket is no exception — ditto their real leather <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">version</a>. It features all the classic details but at a snip of the price. This one runs a little on the small side, so if you can get to the store, we’d recommend trying on different sizes, especially if you want to echo a louche ‘borrowed-from-the-boys’ look. “I tend to size up at least by two sizes, to get a slouchy, oversized fit,” says Hughes. “Zara's faux leather jackets are great – in classic black or in pastel shades,” she adds.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XXL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Fit:</strong> Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-acne-studios-leather-biker-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Acne Studios Leather Biker Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Acne Studios Leather Biker Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WNsiE8Sfq3b3qHU1Mf6q_su2__c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/acne-studios-leather-biker-jacket-63aa83ca1b8e49d091c39339507bf164.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Acne Studios</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>The price isn’t for the faint-hearted, but it’s an investment piece and if you look after it well, it should last a lifetime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“If you're splurging, you can't go wrong with Acne Studios – their jackets just get better and better with age.” says writer Natalie Hughes. Her hot tip is to always check eBay. “If you look hard enough you can find vintage leather jackets that look like Acne at a snip of the price tag,” she explains. If you’re ready for the real deal, it doesn’t get better than the Scandinavian label’s cult classic. Replete with signature details — zippered pockets, a notched collar, and a buckled belt at the hem — this timeless style is structured from buttery Nappa leather that’ll become unique to you with wear. “Acne Studios are renowned for their leather jackets, and their reign won't be coming to an end anytime soon – their classic designs and perfect fit make them a reliable choice,” Bellot adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>FR32–FR42<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material</strong>: Leather, viscose | <strong>Fit: </strong>Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-good-american-oversized-faux-leather-blazer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Oversized Faux Leather Blazer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Oversized Faux Leather Blazer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/de2NPa3eZ0WB0gmbVtAyZdxEY44=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/good-american-oversized-faux-leather-blazer-b0febe10efa14fb8852f24c6bdcc860f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Emma Grede and Khloe Kardashian’s brand Good American is better than good…it’s great.

Yes, it’s on the pricier side, but that’s expected when you’re working with animal products. On the other hand, you are gaining a piece that will last you a lifetime. It will only gain value as you live through this piece, never having to worry about it breaking down. The reviews quite literally rave about how incredible this looks and feels, vouching that no other motorcycle jacket compares. Since it doesn’t look too glossy or polished, you can easily wear it as an everyday piece, too. Throw it on no matter what the occasion, and watch as you slowly neglect every other jacket in your closet. Some comments do point out that it runs a little small, so size up if you hope to layer sweaters underneath.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XXL, petit, standard, plus |<strong> Colors: </strong>5<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material</strong>: Leather | <strong>Fit: </strong>Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-blazer-princess-polly-morrison-faux-leather-blazer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Blazer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Princess Polly Morrison Faux Leather Blazer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Princess Polly Morrison Faux Leather Blazer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JEMqXhb7gPXjxHos60lxdRwNpp4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/princess-polly-morrison-faux-leather-blazer-a8ac172394b24b219f4b2ed71a1430a2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Princess Polly</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We don’t know about you, but we scroll through Princess Polly’s website at least once a week in search of new finds and closet must-haves. And when we came across this faux leather blazer, we immediately added it to our carts after reading the rave reviews. Not only is the burnt brown hue a fun change from the classic black we typically see in leather jackets, but the slouchy fit and vegan leather material give off such a classic vibe. There are tons of ways to style this, but we especially love wardrobe stylist Tracy Shapoff’s advice: “For daytime, pair your leather blazer with baggy denim shorts, a T-shirt, chunky socks, and sneakers. Transitioning into the evening, swap your bottoms with a pair of black leather pants for a sexy mix of brown and black leather. If that is too much leather for your liking, a maxi skirt will be the perfect day-to-night combo with this blazer.” And while we adore the brown hue, we’d love to see the brand add black to the lineup.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Vegan leather | <strong>Fit:</strong> Relaxed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-colored-blank-nyc-faux-leather-moto-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Colored</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Blank NYC Faux Leather Moto Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Blank NYC Faux Leather Moto Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JP4iOL-sVigu_F2gnSlEiIEAC1k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BlankNYCFauxLeatherMotoJacket-e78ca3b9ecfe4890a7f06e44f099fa99.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s a combination you don’t typically see: pastels on a moto-style jacket. And that’s precisely why it stands out. Something about adding a soft touch to an otherwise edgy piece thrills our little hearts. Half zips can be found on both sleeves (be warned: some think they're a bit too long), while the classic biker collars cross over to an overlapping front zip. BLANKNYC, which excels in making modern wardrobe staples, has perfected making faux leather over the years. This piece is a great example of their craftsmanship and would make for great accent outerwear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyurethane, viscose | <strong>Fit:</strong> Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bomber-banana-republic-leather-bomber-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bomber</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Banana Republic Leather Bomber Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Banana Republic Leather Bomber Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4wEUwq-dSjC8oCilYyH8N8Xu1ig=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/banana-republic-leather-bomber-jacket-30a0916fbf5f46c98cf28eae386fed91.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Banana Republic</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>It’s cropped and fitted, which makes it difficult to wear with chunky knits or long, untucked shirts.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another fantastic 100 percent leather option, this bomber jacket from Banana Republic has that old-school aesthetic. But rather than being oversize, which tends to be the default for brands creating vintage-like pieces, it sits close to your body with sleeves that crop just at your wrists. Both the cuffs and hem end in a ribbed knit, too, for an athletic touch. Big minimalist pockets are found at the front as well, which feed into <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the bomber aesthetic</a>. But perhaps the winning point lies in the Sherpa collar — it’s that one feminine touch that really brings this piece together and makes it stand out. Naturally, if you wish for a looser, oversized fit, we recommend sizing up. If biker jackets aren’t really your style, but you still want something leather, this is a fantastic alternative.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material</strong>: Leather, polyester Sherpa | <strong>Fit: </strong>Slim</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-allsaints-elora-leather-biker-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cropped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>AllSaints Leather Biker Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="AllSaints Elora Leather Biker Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rJqVmrjWQWhUhR7gA0wMmk7as-U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/allsaints-elora-leather-biker-jacket-80f90c01d6fb48879082eba66b3ddebe.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>AllSaints</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can add a little edge to your closet by opting for a cropped biker jacket. Made of lamb leather, this is another piece that will stand the test of time. This one comes with gold zips, rather than the classic silver, and has a little ticket pocket on the right side of the jacket. Don’t worry, there’s still plenty of space to rest your hands in the two full-sized pockets on each side. The sleeves are also cut short, ending just around your wrists. Overall, it has a slim fit and is intended to sit close to your body. You won’t have much room to layer chunky knits underneath, but it’s ideal for a spring or fall dress or high-waisted jeans.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0–12 |<strong> Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material</strong>: Lamb leather, recycled polyester | <strong>Fit: </strong>Slim</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-embroidered-free-people-christy-moto-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Embroidered</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Free People Christy Moto Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Free People Christy Moto Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9rFNoRcFfutonmx8ni8eMiBhZ80=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/free-people-christy-moto-jacket-7123c0d8e5544cf9aa34bb682474c9d1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Are you ready for the rodeo? Because this jacket sure is. The classic moto silhouette features 11 stars embroidered on the back in various sizes (and that come in four different colors), giving it an unmistakable Western and Americana appeal that has us even considering swapping our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>polished loafers</a> for some cowboy boots. Even though it’s made of real lambskin, compared to other options on this list, it comes at a lower price point, allowing more people to get in on the trend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from the embroidery, though, the jacket features other various eye-catching accents, like a red fabric lining inside the pockets, zipped cuffs, and two buckle belts. We wouldn’t be surprised if we caught Lana Del Rey wearing this exact jacket. Just know that it runs quite small, with almost all the reviews pointing out that shoppers have needed to size up.

With a line of leather fringe going across the back and cascading down the arms, some might find the amount of fringe to be too much, but we think it’s just right. “I particularly love the belt around the waist for a sleek look,” says fashion stylist Kat Gosik. “At $299, this jacket is a steal as it’s timeless.

It comes in a distressed bronze-y hue with silver hardware and looks like it was plucked from your father's closet in the ‘80s. And if you’re not super into thrifting but love the look of it, this will be right up your alley. “You could wear it in colder weather with a sweater under, or in warmer climates with a tee or tank,” Gosik says. It's already oversize, but if you plan to layer it atop chunky knits, you may want to go up a size to allow for extra room, especially in the arm area.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XXL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather | <strong>Fit:</strong> Oversize</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-longline-reformation-veda-crosby-90s-longline-leather-blazer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Longline</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Veda Crosby 90s Longline Leather Blazer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Veda Crosby 90s Longline Leather Blazer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9LDAoWe6l3U2dmb-kMWnDBbBWrI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/reformation-veda-crosby-90s-longline-leather-blazer-4ac383fdb4064ab8bfdfd2950d982fcb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=3><p>The length is giving us all of the feels and would look beautiful paired over a dress, skirt, jeans, or even slacks.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Reformation is every It girl’s best-kept secret, and if you’re ever wondering how to get their quintessential style, we think investing in a piece from the brand is your best bet. We’re living for this leather blazer not only because of the ‘90s vibes it gives off but also because of its sustainability efforts. In fact, this jacket is chrome-free, a leather byproduct, and vegetable-tanned, so you can rest easy knowing you’re shopping with a trusted brand! “This trench coat will be your new best friend for fall and winter,” says stylist Caitlin Jaymes. “A trench coat is a piece that can take you from day to night. Pair it over jeans and a tee during the day or a black mini dress at night.” If you end up ordering this, just make sure to size up if you plan on layering, as the arm area runs pretty small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather | <strong>Fit:</strong> Relaxed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fur-lined-helsa-80s-oversized-faux-shearling-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fur-Lined</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Helsa 80s Oversized Faux Shearling Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Revolve Helsa 80s Oversized Faux Shearling Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WGxiIwZVo_ZLBh3XSYG2nl5iHJY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/helsa-80s-oversized-faux-shearling-jacket-dc515be6ebee42858c1ef59001ed81e7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Statement jackets are a great addition to your wardrobe because they require less thinking when you're putting an outfit together,” says Jaymes.

It's a racer style complete with quilted details and a snap collar. Rosales loves its polished nature and recommends wearing it with a scarf layered on top since there's no collar to interfere with it. We’d suggest sizing up since it comes in a standard fit, which might look and feel a bit tight on the arm area.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0–12 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather, polyester | <strong>Fit:</strong> Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Price&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to genuine leather jackets, don’t be surprised that the price is higher.

Ultimately, every leather jacket is different and it’ll depend on its fabrication, construction, and age, especially if you’re buying vintage or second-hand.
