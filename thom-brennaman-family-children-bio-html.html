He mostly gives running commentary for the Cincinnati Reds team and has worked for major networks including <span style=color:#000>CBS Radio and Fox Sports.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>He has also done voice-over work for games such as&nbsp;Microsoft Baseball 2001&nbsp;and&nbsp;All-Star Baseball&nbsp;2002.</p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Bio, Family</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Thom was born on 12th September 1963 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>He is the firstborn of famous&nbsp;sportscaster Marty Brennaman and&nbsp;his mother, Brenda Chambers. His father was inducted in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000. He is still listed among the top 50 broadcasters of all time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>As for siblings, Thom has step-sisters from his father's second marriage with Amanda Ingram.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Health Issues</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>On May 2016, the sportscaster took a break from the commentary booth to undergo throat surgery to prevent and alleviate hoarseness in his voice. Since a sportscasters voice is an indispensable tool in his/her career, the operation was about more than curing&nbsp;health illness. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Recommended Sportscaster</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Kyle Martino Wife, Children, Net Worth</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>But, after a brief check-up, his doctors found out that his job as a sports commentator had quite taken an unhealthy toll on his health. The damage was more than expected, and during his surgery, a lot of scar tissue had to be removed from his throat.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Since the surgery involved cutting off his vocal cord, Thom was unable to talk properly for many weeks.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>However,&nbsp;his children cleverly hung a small whiteboard around his neck to communicate, and he had to practice specific vocal exercises to strengthen his voice. With family support, he soon recovered and returned in July the same year to do commentary on the final two games of the Cincinnati Reds. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Net Worth In Recent Years Plus Wife</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>As of now, Thom hasnâ€™t come across any throat related issues.
