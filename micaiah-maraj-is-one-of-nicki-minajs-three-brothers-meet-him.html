Nicki Minaj’s siblings enjoy anonymity because they never try to leverage their link to her for fame.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is all we know about one of her brothers,&nbsp;Micaiah, and the rest of her siblings.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/micai-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Micaiah_Maraj></span>Who Is Micaiah Maraj?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Micaiah Maraj is one of Nicki Minaj’s three brothers. He is known to keep a low profile and generally flies under the radar. However, he has a good bond with his famous sister.&nbsp;</p><p>In September 2016, she joked about crowdsourcing him a date on Twitter. She wondered if she could increase the probability of getting him a new girlfriend by throwing a girls-only party with women in his age range.</p><p>She also revealed the qualities she wants to see in his girlfriend. According to her, she has to be “pleasant, ambitious, and understanding.”&nbsp;The talented rapper also specified that all races were welcome to send their applications for the hypothetical party.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Micaiah_Maraj></span>How Old Is Micaiah Maraj?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Micaiah Maraj is currently 25 years old. He was born on March 29, 1998.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Micaiah_Maraj_Do></span>What Does Micaiah Maraj Do?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since he lives a very private life, little is known about what Micaiah does in his free time. If he already had a career, it is far from the spotlight as there is barely any information on it now.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Siblings_Does_Nicki_Minaj_Have></span>How Many Siblings Does Nicki Minaj Have?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nicki Minaj has four siblings, brothers: Micaiah Maraj and Jelani Maraj, and half-siblings: Brandon Lamar and Ming Maraj.&nbsp;She was born and raised in Trinidad & Tobago until her family relocated to Queens, New York when she was five.&nbsp;</p><p>Her childhood was not easy as she was not born to wealthy parents. Her father, Robert Maraj, was also <a href=#>an abusive addict</a>. Nicki Minaj’s family did not want him around because of that.&nbsp;In the first few months they spent in America, Nicki would always pray for God to provide her with means to care for her mom so she could escape her father’s tyranny.&nbsp;</p><p>The man wreaked havoc on their finances because of his addiction and did terrible things, like setting the house on fire with their mother still in it.&nbsp;Robert denied these allegations in the past, and things have improved between him and his kids.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Micaiahs_Other_Siblings></span>Micaiah’s Other Siblings&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aside from Nicki, Micaiah has three other siblings. His half-brother, Brandon Lamar, is the most famous of them as he is also into showbiz like Nicki.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/niiiick.jpg><p>Brandon is famously known as a rapper and singer like Nicki Minaj. He achieved fame in 2007 and has some popular hits, including “Control” and “Raw.” Brandon is also known to create content on his YouTube channel, “BrandonLamarMusic.”&nbsp;</p><p>Micaiah’s older brother Jelani also lives a primarily private life. However, in 2014, he made headlines after he was <a href=#>indicted</a> on charges of repeatedly raping a 12-year-old girl. Jelani was eventually found guilty of repeatedly raping the girl at his Long Island home in January 2020.</p><p>Nassau County Supreme Court Judge Robert McDonald was so disturbed by the case that he refused to show Jelani mercy by granting him a soft sentence. Rumors at the time <a href=#>claimed</a> that Nicki was the one who paid for his $100,000 bail, causing many to lash out at her.&nbsp;</p><p>It worsened after she shared a photo of her hugging him amid the drama. Her fans did not take kindly to it, and many urged her to delete the post because of Jelani’s predatory sexual assault past.</p><p>Micaiah Maraj’s second sister Ming is the youngest of the group. She is beloved by her older siblings, especially <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>, who started posting her as far back as 2013.&nbsp;Ming is now more aged and shaping up to be a social media influencer.</p><p>Her Instagram page boasts over 90k followers, and her videos get lots of love from her fans.&nbsp;She also seems to have musical talents as she enjoys posting lyrics she writes on her Instagram page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqqvwKKYoWWdlr%2Bitoyiqmannpp6sLKMp6Cco5liuqq6wKOqZqyYp7KmecGrpq2glafAbrnEnqtmoJmifA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./superstar-galloper-golden-sixtys-future-remains-air-after-champions-mile-defeat.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Superstar galloper Golden Sixtys future remains up in the air after Champions Mile defeat | HK Ra</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./slow-cooker-buttermilk-herb-mashed-potatoes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Make Slow-Cooker Buttermilk Herb Mashed Potatoes| First For Women</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
