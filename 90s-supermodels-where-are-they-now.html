She has kept a relatively low profile in recent years after she was left "permanently deformed" by a cosmetic procedure. The model took legal action and the case has since been settled. Venturing back into modelling for the first time since the procedure, Linda featured in a Fendi campaign to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its iconic 'Baguette' bag, and made a serious comeback on the cover of British Vogue's September 2022 issue.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-gid=euPDhD-ygER0>Christy Turlington</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/62a6ddf8470c-christy-turlington-90s.jpg><p id=et-X-fUMAu data-wc=57>"The most beautiful woman in the world", according to Grace Coddington, Christy Turlington started modelling after school in her teens.

Having walked for Chanel, Versace and Helmut Lang, she retired in 1997, with the intention of starting a family. She now lives in New York with her husband Ralph Bernstein with their two children.</p><h2><strong>Elle Macpherson</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c5175404067f-elle-macpherson-runway.jpg><p id=eHDiJHK714u- data-wc=70>Australian model Elle Macpherson first entered the modelling scene back in the early 1980s when she was merely trying to make some money to fund her law degree.
