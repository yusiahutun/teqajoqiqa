It's out there. A Pinterest for food? It exists. A Pinterest for memes? You're in luck. We have compiled a list of the 7 best apps and sites like Pinterest.</p><h2 id=we-heart-it>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We Heart It</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/we-heart-it.jpg><p>If we had to describe We Heart It in one sentence, we would call it the offspring of Pinterest and Tumblr. We Heart It is a place where users can be themselves and post up pretty much anything they wantâ€”cat pictures, melodramatic quotes, cute outfits, landscapes, food, and more.</p><p>There's an undercurrent beneath all of the We Heart It posts thatindicates that this site is mainly used by teens and college girls. There isn't as much wedding planning, but there's a bit more teenage angst. If you're looking for more sites like Pinterest that are geared towards young women, We Heart It is for you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dribbble>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dribbble</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/dribble.jpg><p>According to its homepage, Dribbble is the "leading destination to find and showcase creative work". For all of you creative folks out there, Dribbble is the perfect outlet for you to answer the question: "What are you working on right now?".</p><p>Whether you're designing websites, movie posters, typography, pixel art, company logos, architecture, or whatever else, you can use Dribbble to share your work. It's a great way to show off <a href=#>things you can create in Canva</a>, Photoshop, and other design tools.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not a designer yourself? That's fine, too. Feel free to explore the posts on Dribbble (called "shots" as opposed to "pins" or "posts") to get a glimpse into the minds of various creators. If you can appreciate art in all of its forms, there's a lot of content here that will blow your mind.</p><h2 id=foodgawker>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FoodGawker</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/foodgawker.jpg><p>Are you a foodie? If so, you'll fall in love with FoodGawker in no time. This Pinterest-inspired website is not only an excellent place to discover new dishes, ingredients, and beautiful photographs of food, it's also a great site to find plenty of online cooking guides for beginners or experts.</p><p>A word of warning: do not browse this site when you're hungry, or you might find your desk covered in a pool of drool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The only downside to FoodGawker is that it's curated. You can submit your own photographs and links, but the editors review all submissions and have the final say on what gets published. On the one hand, this maintains a high standard of quality, but it does end up losing some of its Pinterest-esque appeal.</p><p>For an even better experience, use FoodGawker with a browser extension that can help you save recipes for later and even create shopping lists for you. If you are a Chrome user, our guide on the <a href=#>best Chrome extensions for cooking inspiration</a> can help you with just that.</p><h2 id=pearltrees>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pearltrees</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pearltrees.jpg><p>Pearltrees is a hub for all of your interests.

As soon as you add an item, Pearltrees will provide you with similar collections made by other users.</p><p>Pearltrees gives you 1GB of storage for free, but you'll have to pay a subscription fee to get additional storage and more features.</p><h2 id=mix>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mix</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mix-restaurants.jpg><p>Mix, previously known as StumbleUpon, is a great alternative to Pinterest. When you grab the Mix app, you'll choose from several topics you'd like to see in your feed, including fashion, architecture, music, funny posts, nature, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you see a post you like, you can hit the <strong>Mix</strong> button, which adds it to a collection on your profile. You can also share this collection with others. Mix uses these posts to curate a personalized feed of content. If you want to see what other users are mixing, you can also head to the <strong>Popular</strong> tab.</p><h2 id=dwellinggawker>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DwellingGawker</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/dwellinggawker.jpg><p>DwellingGawker is from the same creators as FoodGawker, but it focuses on <a href=#>interior design and architecture inspiration</a>, rather than food.</p><p>Like FoodGawker, each photo is curated by the site's editors.
