His murder trial got under way in October 1967. The defendant, now 16 years old, was found to be competent to stand trial as an adult.</span><br></p><p><span>Wolcott's defense was that he had known for a while that he was suffering from mental illness, which was made worse by his addiction to airplane glue. Doctors later diagnosed his condition as paranoid schizophrenia</span>.<br></p><p><span>Depositions presented during the trial showed that James believed that his family were trying to drive him mad, or destroy him.</span></p><p><span>During his psychological evaluation, the teen stated that his mother chewed her food too loudly and that his sister had a really bad accent. In his talks with a classmate, James also mentioned that his father would complain about his long hair and would not let him go to a peace rally or wear anti-Vietnam buttons. </span><span><br></span></p><p><span>At the end of the six-month trial, an all-male jury acquitted Wolcott by reason of insanity. He was admitted on February 2, 1968, into Rusk State Hospital, where he were to remain until he became sane again.&nbsp;</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/03/article-0-1B20057F000005DC-575_634x744.jpg height=744 width=634 alt="Confession: After initially feigning shock over the murders of his family, the 15-year-old admitted to shooting his parents and sister, telling investigators that he hated them" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Confession: After initially feigning shock over the murders of his family, the 15-year-old admitted to shooting his parents and sister, telling investigators that he hated them</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/03/article-0-1B200633000005DC-719_634x669.jpg height=669 width=634 alt="Getting away with murder: After being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia exacerbated by drug use, Wolcott was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a hospital for six years" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Getting away with murder: After being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia exacerbated by drug use, Wolcott was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a hospital for six years</p><p><span>The son of James' defense lawyer told the paper that according to his father, one of Wolcott's psychiatrists at the hospital felt sorry for him and invited him to live in his own home.</span><br></p><p><span>In 1974, Wolcott was released from the institution after being cleared by the hospital administrator.
