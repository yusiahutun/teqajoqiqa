And if you thought you had watched it all, wait until you hear (if you still haven't got wind of it) of Mark Winger's murder case. For years, he was considered the saviour before shocking revelations made him a prime suspect leading to a successful conviction.

And that is why detectives in such cases miss apparent clues.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, Mark Winger managed to walk scot-free after the murder of his wife, only to be realized later that he was the perpetrator. And that is when detectives connected the dots. Bizarre indeed.

A husband killed his wife most offensively. Their story started with falling in love but ended in death and tears. So, how did it <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">all begin</a>?</p><p class=align-left>Donnah (the oldest of three sisters) met Mark and immediately fell in love with him. The relationship blossomed, leading to a marriage in 1989. Also, Donnah got a job as an operating room technician while Mark worked as a nuclear engineer. They settled in Springfield, Illinois, and everything was perfect.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c7dc028956d79eb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jana Reynolds's story: What really happened and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, Donnah wanted a child for her happy life to be complete. So, she was devastated when she discovered that she couldn't get pregnant.</p><p class=align-left>Fortunately for Donnah, she got a call from the hospital about a teenager looking to give up her child for adoption.</p><p class=align-left>Everything worked out quite well, and they had the baby home within no time. The couple enjoyed their new roles as parents and spending time together. Also, Donnah met DeAnn Schultz at the hospital. She would later become her best friend.</p><h2>How did Donnah Winger die?</h2><p class=align-left>According to people, Mark and Donnah had a perfect life, and nothing could have indicated that something terrible would happen. However, a frantic 911 call on August 29, 1995, broke the shocking news of <a href=#>a murder</a> at the Mark Winger residence.</p><p class=align-left>According to the 911 call, Mark Winger reported that someone was killing his wife. Also, he stated that he had shot the person. Once detectives arrived at the scene, they found the first victim, Donnah Winger clinging to her life after being hit several times with a hammer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/28b1850dc2040714.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dr John Cavaness: The story of the deadly doctor of Eldorado</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Also, a second victim in the house was a white man who had two gunshot wounds to the head. Yet, miraculously, he still had a pulse when the police arrived.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, Donnah Winger succumbed to the injuries to her head and died shortly after arriving at the hospital.</p><h2>What investigators found out about the case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f89db765034c75ab.png><p class=align-left>Immediately investigators arrived at the crime; they started taking evidence. And Cox, one of the detectives handling the case, got the male victim's identification from his pocket before everything got chaotic. He identified the man as Roger Harrington.</p><p class=align-left>The weirdest thing is that Mark claimed her knew the male subject and that he was harassing his wife. Mark also stated that he was exercising on the treadmill and heard a bang that made him go upstairs.</p><p class=align-left>He further claimed that he heard more noises and decided to take his handgun. Mark used the handgun to shoot Harrington, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">swinging a hammer</a> at his wife.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c7bcf83d293f0f75.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Seth Wrinkles story: what happened to Eric Wrinkles son?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Every detail of the case fell into place based on Mark's account. Cox, who was handling the case, even knew Harrington to be fast to anger, and it was highly likely that he snapped and picked whatever was close to him and used it on Donnah Winger. And that is how it was concluded that Mark had acted in self-defence, and the case was closed after 48 hours.</p><h2>The shocking twist in the murder case</h2><p class=align-left>However, a shocking revelation in 1999 would make detectives think twice and revisit the case. Donnah’s close friend, DeAnn Schultz, informed the police that he had an affair with Mark while Donnah was still alive. Also, she stated that he told her something that bothered her a lot.</p><p class=align-left>Mark also informed DeAnn that he wanted to get Harrington in <a href=#>his house</a>. This was after finding out about her wife’s poor driving experience back to Springfield from the airport.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/61d1c079a0a64c2c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Lori Hayes story: How was Dale Lash arrested and where is he now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Police checked out the crime scene photos and found out that the position of the bodies did not match Mark’s account. And that is how they started suspecting him of the murder of his wife.</p><p class=align-left>At the same time, the company that had employed Roger hired a blood-spatter analyst to analyze the blood spatter at the crime scene. Police also found a bank deposit slip with Mark's name in Roger's car with his address and time.</p><p class=align-left>According to the evidence, the police concluded that Mark had arranged the meeting at his house and lured Roger to blame him for his murder. As a result, they arrested him on August 23, 2001, and charged him with two counts of murder.</p><h2>Where is Mark Winger today?</h2><p class=align-left>What happened to Mark Winger? A lot had happened since 1995 when Mark was considered a hero for trying to save his wife's life. But the discovery that he was the murderer in the case surprised many people.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f18da9befdaee2d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jenny Jones murder updates, documentary, and lawsuit update</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The case went to trial, and the prosecution won the case. As a result, in May 2002, the jury found Mark guilty of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p><p class=align-left>And things did not end there. While in prison, Mark’s murder for hire plot was foiled. He wanted to hire someone to kill DeAnn, who testified against him in court. After going through a court process and the jury deliberating the case, in 2007, Mark was again sentenced to an additional 35 years in prison for solicitation of murder.</p><h2>Who is Mark Winger's second wife?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c7dc028956d79eb.jpg><p class=align-left>After her wife's death, Mark Winger hired a nanny to help him take care of the children.
