When he walked by the pair's parked car, Maldonado opened fire, prompting Villa to seek cover between two cars.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That's when Samudio got out of the car and shot-and-killed Villa, police said. The victim was shot multiple times.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Later that night, police caught up to Samudio and Maldonado and began a police chase. During the pursuit, Samudio is accused of throwing an item from the car.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Eventually the pair got out of the car and ran from cops, prompting officers to use stun guns on them.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Following the chase, investigators recovered a .380 caliber weapon which matched the shell casings that were found at the scene of Villa's murder.
