That would make China’s oldest bank the biggest known victim of April’s melee in the global oil market, surpassing the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">collapse of Singapore’s Hin Leong oil-trading empire</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brutal loss has far-reaching repercussions across China’s banking industry, as several of the country's biggest state-owned lenders – Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Communication Bank of China, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank – have all hit the pause button on variations of the same structured financial product for their retail customers. The episode exposes the deficiencies in China’s 22.2 trillion yuan wealth management products offered by banks, where regulations and investor protection measures fail to keep up with an industry whose rapid growth had been amplified by technology.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The incident has exposed the shortcomings of risk disclosures to retail clients and potentially insufficient or improper risk tolerance and products suitability assessments among Chinese banks,” said Lance Yau Tat-cheung, a dealing department manager of China Xin Yongan Futures.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For China’s banking industry, the fracas with oil futures is also its latest brush with risk in the nation’s journey toward market liberalisation and financial reforms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As part of China's banking reforms, commercial lenders had been prodded and pushed to wean themselves off the fat margins between state-controlled lending and deposit rates that had sustained their growth and prosperity for decades.</p>A consequence of that reform was for banks to earn more income from fees and financial products. Over the past five years, China's banks have launched, and cancelled, futures and options on precious metals and rare metals, high-yield wealth management products disguised as insurance, and even <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">flirted with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies</span></a> before the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">People’s Bank of China</span></a> banned financial institutions from dealing in them.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/01/f5a61be0-89e7-11ea-8a72-3b4a65ec119d_972x_195410.JPG>The implosion of Crude Oil Treasure and products like it may even become a potential source of social unrest, as investors caught in get-rich-quick scams such as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">peer-to-peer lending</span></a> platforms and Ponzi schemes around <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">rare metal trading</span></a> have tended to stage noisy petitions around bank and regulatory offices. More than 60,000 customers are estimated to have invested in Crude Oil Treasure alone, Caixin reported.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For China’s government, the potential public grievance comes at a time when the nation is just emerging from three months of quarantines and work-at-home orders to contain the coronavirus outbreak. China’s legislature is scheduled to commence its annual meetings on May 22, after postponing the proceedings in March. The Great Hall of the People at Tiananmen Square, where the pomp and splendour of the meetings typically go on full display, is a mere subway stop away from Bank of China’s headquarters in Xidan.</p>Concerned about the public backlash, the Chinese bank regulator ordered Bank of China to negotiate with customers and respond to their concerns, strengthen its risk control and product management, according to <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a report by state news agency Xinhua</span></a>. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) would strengthen its scrutiny over such products, Xinhua said.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/01/43647814-89e7-11ea-8a72-3b4a65ec119d_972x_195410.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Launched in January 2018, Crude Oil Treasure allowed customers to hold either long or short positions in oil contracts denominated in US dollars or yuan, where they can bet that the prices of WTI or Brent International would go up or down, all through a simple savings account at the Bank of China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To make investments more accessible, the product subdivided the 1,000 barrels of oil associated with every WTI futures contract into units of barrels.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Investors must close their open positions before their contracts expire by buying or selling the same amount of contracts they sold or bought earlier. Alternatively, they can roll their positions to the next month by letting the trading system conduct the rollover based on the month’s settlement price.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bank acts as the market maker, responsible for managing risks and generating prices based on factors including global oil prices, the renminbi’s exchange rate and market liquidity, it said in a product introduction on its website.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The product is for individuals with “a certain understanding” of the oil market, and have a “commensurate” level of risk tolerance, Bank of China said. It warned investors that they should understand the volatility in oil prices, as well as risks arising from various political and economic factors and global events.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/01/81c8e1de-89f2-11ea-8a72-3b4a65ec119d_972x_195410.JPG>Still, the warnings and disclaimers were insufficient, Wang said in Xi’an, calling Crude Oil Treasure a “flawed product” with extremely high risks that was mislabelled as a medium-risk investment. Bank of China failed to notify investors that prices could turn negative, even after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where the WTI contracts are traded, warned on April 15 that <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">energy futures contracts could trade at negative or zero</span></a>, he said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bank of China is “deeply disturbed” by its customers’ investment losses, according to an April 24 statement. Warnings about volatility and the impending expiry of contracts were sent every day since April 15 via text messages, phone calls, social media posts on WeChat and Weibo, the bank said.</p>The bank is reviewing the design of its financial products as well as its risk management process, and will <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">shoulder its due responsibilities under Chinese law</span></a> to protect clients’ lawful interests the best it could, Bank of China said. The bank has barred customers from taking new positions on all financial products related to the price of crude oil, including those linked to Brent International – the benchmark used in the UK – from April 22.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Had Bank of China acted faster, like one or two days before the WTI contract’s expiry, the losses would not have ballooned to this magnitude,” said Lin Boqiang, director of Xiamen University’s Centre for China Energy Economics Research. “Other banks have not had the same degree of problem as they have forced settlement of the products earlier.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Through products packaging and marketing, the futures nature of the underlying product has been downplayed,” said Yau of China Xin Yongan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Different from standard investment products where investors entrust their money with a professional manager to invest, the Crude Oil Treasure is actually a platform on which investors can make buy and sell orders on their own, said Yang Zhaoquan, partner of Beijing Weinuo Lawfirm, retained by nearly 100 customers of Crude Oil Treasure with 40 million yuan in combined losses to sue on their behalf.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It's against the law for the Bank of China to issue a product like Crude Oil Treasure,” said Yang, who has yet to file their suit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Crude Oil Treasure is in fact a futures product even if it is being marketed as a tool for wealth management. Bank of China, despite being China’s largest global bank, is not licensed to provide futures products, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ant Financial Services, the affiliate of this newspaper’s owner Alibaba Group Holding, distributes a financial product on its Alipay platform by Southern Asset Management that tracks the price of crude oil and exchange-traded funds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Customers applying to trade futures products at equity or futures brokerages would be subjected to more rigorous risk assessment questionnaires, and higher entry barriers, before they are allowed anywhere near their first transactions, said Yau of China Xin Yongan, the Hong Kong unit of mainland brokerage Yongan Futures.</p>May futures contracts settled on April 21 at negative US$37.63, the result of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">lower demand for fuel amid the economic recessions</span></a> wrought by the global coronavirus pandemic, as well as a break down in talks between the world’s largest oil producers to stem the industry’s glut.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wang has allied himself with a dozen investors in representing about 200 Crude Oil Treasure customers in Shaanxi province to seek compensation from Bank of China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They have visited the provincial offices of the bank, as well as the banking regulator, to demand for a revaluation of their holdings based on the April 15 settlement price, when they believe the bank should have informed them about the potential risks. Bank of China said it “handled the May futures contracts according to previous agreements,” in its statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/01/5d73d5ce-89e7-11ea-8a72-3b4a65ec119d_972x_195410.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Given the nature of the market at the moment, it is clearly risky to leave it so close to the end, given some of the pretty well-flagged risk that storage capacities were approaching their limits globally,” said Sanford Bernstein’s senior oil and gas analyst Neil Beveridge. “Traders are squeezed when it approaches the contract’s expiry date.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Emily Liu, a 35-year-old mechanical design engineer in Hangzhou, is among the hundreds of investors in Zhejiang province who are petitioning the regulators to bail out their losses. With 160,000 yuan in losses, Liu joined six chat groups on WeChat, each with about 200 members, with as much as 7 million yuan in individual losses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Wang, though, lessons have been learned the hard way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“All hope is gone,” Wang said. “I hadn't been able to sleep and I have no appetite to eat since this happened.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfmLWqusBmma6rmaOytL%2BOmqmtoZOhsnB%2Fj3Fpa3FoZK%2BiuspmmqGhnpbAbsHSamSboZyhtrC6jKGmpZ1dpbm2usaipaBln565br%2FHqK6sZZikxA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bethenny-frankel-i-dont-like-the-feeling-of-being-full.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bethenny Frankel: I don't like the feeling of being full | Lifestyles</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./476790-what-happened-kalecia-williams-chilling-story-tiktoker.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What happened to Kalecia Williams?
