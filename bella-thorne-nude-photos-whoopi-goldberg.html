"@zendaya called me today to make sure I was ok, we talked a lot about this generation, the one before us as well, and how as women we shouldn't feel bad about ourselves our bodies.

"Good for you baby girl. I'm so proud of you for speaking up," she wrote. "This breaks my heart.

Proud of you for what you did and how you're speaking out about it," Depp wrote. "You're absolutely right and anyone who's saying otherwise is just wrong, living in another century, and clearly completely unconcerned by what repercussions words like that might have as it relates to young people and how they view their sexualities and bodies.

I love women. Everyone should love women. Don't be an asshole! Sexuality is part of being HUMAN. But judgement and objectification is not. Ugh, I can't handle to ugly."</p><p>Singer <a href=#><strong>Madison Beer</strong></a> also sent Thorne love and support, writing "THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. Why aren't we talking about the men who betrayed our trust and humiliated us?

The morning host claimed no famous person should be surprised if their nudes leak.</p><p>"If you're famous, I don't care how old you are," Goldberg said. "You don't take nude pictures of yourself. Once you take that picture it goes into the Cloud and it's available to any hacker who wants it, and if you don't know that in 2019 that this is an issue, I'm sorry. You don't get to do that."</p><p>Thorne hit back at Goldberg on Instagram <strong><a href=#>in a series of emotional videos to her Stories</a></strong>, in which "The Duff" star spoke through tears.</p><p>"Shame on you, Whoopi," Thorne said. "Shame on you and shame on you for putting that public opinion just out there like that for every young girl to think that they're disgusting for even taking a photo like that."</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
