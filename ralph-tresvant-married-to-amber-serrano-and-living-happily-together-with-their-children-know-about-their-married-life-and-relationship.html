The pop singer has a very interesting romantic side of personal life as he has been in some serious relationships.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ralph Tresvant</strong></a> the&nbsp;lead singer and songwriter of the R&B band New Edition has&nbsp;never been&nbsp;away from the spotlight due to his successful profession, but regarding his marriage life, one cannot say whether it's going smoothly or not.</p><p>Also known as Rizz and Rizzo, Ralph fell in love at a very early age. Looks like, besides singing, the singer was into dating from the beginning&nbsp;as he started going at the age of 11 with his childhood sweetheart <a href=# rel=noopener>Shelly Jean</a>. R&B lovers, let's peek into the nostalgic star's love life.</p><h2>Ralph Tresvant's Married Life With Wife Amber Serrano</h2><p>Ralph is married to his longtime fan&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Amber Serrano</a></strong>. Ralph and Amber first met while Amber was just a 13-year-old and a big fan of Ralph. When they met for the second time, they immediately fell for each other and exchanged numbers. Soon they hit it off and started dating. Amber soon came to the limelight as their dating news spread in the media.</p><p>The couple tied the knot in September 2004 after eight years of a serious relationship. Ralph and Amber exchanged vows in a joint wedding ceremony along with co-band member <strong>Ricky Bell</strong> and his wife <strong>Amy Correa</strong>.</p><p>Later in the year, the couple was blessed with a son&nbsp;<strong>Dakari Tresvant</strong> who is now all grown up to be a handsome man.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/05/ralph-tresvant-and-amber-s.jpg alt="Ralph Tresvant with wife Amber Serrano" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Ralph Tresvant with wife Amber Serrano&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Essence</strong></p><p>Since Amber is not from the entertainment industry there is very little public appearance of the duo. Lately, some speculations are going on that their marriage is not like before. During this year's Valentine's Day, the couple didn't express their love for one another on their social media platform, and it's been a long time since they uploaded any picture of them together.&nbsp;</p><p>Amber even posted a picture of her wearing no wedding ring. Judging by their recent relationship looks like their marriage is facing various obstacles. However, the singer hasn't spoken about it to date.</p><h2>Ralph's Previous Relationships</h2><p>Ralph, the 54-year-old singer has a pretty decorative relationship history. Ralph fell in love at the age of 11 with his childhood sweetheart Shelly Jean. Their childhood love story became a serious relationship and the couple dated for over a decade.</p><p>The lovebirds took their relationship to the next level by tying the knot in 1993. The couple has three children; two daughters and a son.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/05/ralph-tresvant-wife.jpg alt="Ralph Tresvant's First Wife Shelly and Their First Daughter Na’Quelle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Ralph Tresvant's&nbsp;first wife Shelly and their daughter Na’Quelle</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Heightline</strong></p><p>But fate had something else in store because, after only a few years of their marriage, Ralph was rumored to have an extramarital affair with his current wife Amber.</p><p>With such controversies, problems began to arise in their conjugal life, and it eventually led to the couple getting divorced in 1996 only after three years of marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>There was also news that Ralph was having an affair with Lisa Wu. The cheating deeply affected Shelly and soon after their divorce, she gave in to drugs. According to various sources, the singer's wife is homeless in Atlanta.</p><p>Not only that, she is also addicted to drugs and alcohol. A close friend of hers even mentioned Shelly snapped right after her divorce from Ralph.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ralph Tresvant: Quick Facts</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/05/ralph-tresvant-123.jpg alt="Ralph Tresvant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp; Monarchmagazine</strong></p><ul><li>He was born on 16 May 1968 in Roxbury, Massachusetts.</li><li>His parents are <strong>Patricia Tresvant</strong> and <strong>Ralph Edward Tresvant</strong>.</li><li>He grew up with his two siblings, sister <strong>LaTonya </strong>and brother <strong>Andre</strong>.</li><li>His ethnicity is African&nbsp;American.</li><li>His sun sign is Taurus.</li><li>His height is 5'8" (1.73 m)</li><li>He released his&nbsp;first solo album Sensitivity in 1990.</li><li>His estimated <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> is <strong>$8 million</strong>.</li></ul><p>Don't miss out on more at <a href=# rel=noopener>Married Wiki</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnyzrcupn2asoprAt63NrWSmmaKntqawjK2mZpmdl7KzedKeqauZnqR6orrDZqOirpmjtG60wKmnoqSpYsGws8Stn56qXay2tbSMrZ%2BeoaJisKm1y52pnqZdoLuww4yamaitpGLBqbHIq2SmmaKntqawjKWgn51dlruledGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-10-best-jailbreak-films.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 best jailbreak films | Culture</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cathryn-sealey.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nettles Wife Cathryn Sealey Bio, Net Worth 2022, Her Personal Life, Kids</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
