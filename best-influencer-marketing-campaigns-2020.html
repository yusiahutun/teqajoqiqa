There were several different influencer marketing strategies and trends in 2020. Since influencer marketing is a highly effective and popular form of marketing, both brands and influencers seem to enjoy participating in collaborations for the best results. As we enter 2021, let’s look back at the most memorable influencer marketing campaigns that drew attention and became successful from the previous year.</span></p><h2><strong>What do the best influencer campaigns of 2020 have in common?</strong></h2><p>When we look at the most influential influencer marketing campaigns of the last year, we can see that they have a lot in common. They all carry the traits which make for a successful use of influencers. They’re all relevant and engaging campaigns, have a wide reach, and draw a lot of attention to the brand they promote. Further, they’re all creative to the point where you feel the need to revisit them again and again.</p><h2><strong><span class=s1>McDonald’s X Travis Scott</span></strong></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>One of the most memorable, biggest and best influencer marketing campaigns of 2020 was the collaboration of McDonald’s and Travis Scott under the name of #CactusJack in the fall of 2020, as the two teamed up to promote his favorite McDonald’s meal.</span></p><p class=p1>This was the first time in 30 years that McDonald’s has featured a celebrity-inspired meal since Michael Jordan in 1992.</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1><strong>What makes it one of the best&nbsp;influencer campaigns of 2020?</strong></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=Apple-converted-space>Scott has a massive audience of 45 million followers across Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, and his presence in a creative post is enough to start chatter on social media among millions of fans and followers.</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>After two weeks of the Cactus Jack Meal release,<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>it achieved over 125 million post views and almost 500 million in impressions. Even Google Trends reported an increase in web searches since the campaign launch. The campaign was successful not only in starting conversations but inspiring user-generated content and TikTok trends such as memes, hashtags, and video pranks which have furthered the campaign’s reach across major social platforms.</span></p><h2><strong><span class=s1>BMW x Falco Punch, Sky & Tami, and PatroX</span></strong></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Tiktok has become the most downloaded app in 2020. Its short video contents are easy to reach and fun to watch. Although Instagram holds the leading influencer marketing tool, TikTok is getting more and more attraction from many brands. Especially if a product aims at Gen Z audiences, then TikTok seems like a perfect platform to apply your influencer marketing strategies.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>One of the most successful influencer marketing campaigns conducted on TikTok this year was started by BMW. The brand launched its new 1 series with the hashtag #the1challenge. This challenge required TikTok influencers to show their dancing skills according to moves specifically created for the campaign. They then challenged other users to try the moves and show off their dancing skills as well.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The hashtag got almost 10 million views.</span></p><h2><strong><span class=s1>Yeehaw Cowboy x Jeremiah Craig</span></strong></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>It is another example of how brands can benefit from influencers. Yeehaw Cowboy is a niche business that sells cowboy boots online. In the very end of 2019, the brand decided to collaborate with YouTuber Jeremiah Craig after seeing uploads videos on country music and cowboy boots, which lead to one of the best influencer campaigns we’ve seen in 2020.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>A micro influencer and a niche business came together, and it resulted in over $60.000 revenue for Yeehaw Cowboy Boots.</span></p><p></p><h2><strong><span class=s1>MKHB X Dbrand</span></strong></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Giveaways are so popular recently. They aimed for reaching a bigger audience by making people follow them to get the prize.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Dbrand took this chance to increase the brand’s visibility and collaborated with MKHB who a phone skin manufacturer is.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>It is not their first collaboration; they have a long-lasting partnership.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Dbrand hosted a major smartphone and PS5 giveaway on MKHB’s YouTube channel.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The brand tried to gain followers and increased sales with the help of an influencer whose audience is most interested in smartphones</span><span class=s2>&nbsp;and technological devices.</span></p><p></p><h2><span class=s1><strong>Kimchi Chic Beauty x Naomi Smalls</strong></span></h2><p class=p6><span class=s1>Kim Chi Beauty collaborated with the friend Naomi Smalls from RuPaul’s Drag Race Show. It is the first collaboration between two drag queens ever.</span></p><p class=p6><span class=s1>They launched a desert-themed collection with many bright colors and shimmers. Half of the colors was chosen by Kim and the rest by Naomi, the effect of their distinct personalities is clearly seen in the collection.</span></p><p class=p6><span class=s1>They encourage trying what their audiences want to do without being discouraged by people’s judgment and don’t worry about messing up.</span></p><p class=p6><span class=s1>It is a memorable influencer marketing campaign for being the first drag queen collaboration.</span></p><p><strong>These were a few of the best influencer marketing campaigns of 2020.
