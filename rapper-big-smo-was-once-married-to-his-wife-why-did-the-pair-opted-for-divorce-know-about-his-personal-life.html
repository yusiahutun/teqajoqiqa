Know about his Personal life and Net Worth</p><p>Most of the rappers are very open about their relationship and we all know everything regarding every aspect of their personal life to professional life.&nbsp;</p><p>But Rapper Big Smo isn't one of them. He doesn't talk much when it comes to his marriage, however, he is happy being a father to his children.&nbsp;</p><p>If you didn't have&nbsp;any idea that he is a father then surely you will enjoy knowing more of his hidden personal life. Let's roll!</p><h2>Big Smo-Marriage and Children</h2><p>He started his music career in the late 1990s. From the beginning, he was so interested in making rap and used to create rhymes while studying in high school.</p><p>Then in the early 2000s, his career took a huge leap and he&nbsp;became a sensation in the world of rapping. Since then he is enjoying a good successful professional life.</p><p>He even appeared in many TV series such as his own self-titled show&nbsp;Big Smo and&nbsp;Bar Rescue. He also made a small appearance in the series, Heartlandia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/12/rszthe-10-best-big-smo-songs-of-all-time.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Big Smo was once married to his wife with whom he shares three daughters</p><p>Source: Full Redneck</p><p>Moving towards his personal life, the rapper married twice, but both ended in&nbsp;a divorce. Though the name of his first wife isn't out in the open yet, we do know he is a father to three girls from his first marriage.</p><p>True, he never could become a good husband to his wife, but he is an exceptional father to his girls, <strong>Lancia Crocker, America Crocker,</strong> and <strong>Ansley Crocker</strong>. He posts several pictures with his daughters and showers affection towards them.</p><p>On the occasion of Father's day, he praised his girls to make him a good man and a great father.&nbsp;</p><p>He and his first wife share the joint custody of their daughters. His girls are all grown up and graduated from their respective high school.</p><h2>Big Smo-Second Marriage</h2><p>After his first failed marriage, he started dating&nbsp;Whitney Deann Smith. The pair moved in together and stayed together for more than 7-years.&nbsp;</p><p>They tied the knot in 2013 and disclosed this big news to his fans in no time. The relationship went well for around 2-years and later due to some incident, rumors of their divorce started coming out.</p><p>A source close to the pair in an interview revealed the reason and said,</p><p>“For some time, Whitney has suspected that there was another women involved with her husband.”</p><p>Big Smo then filed for divorce and went on his tour in August. Upon receiving the papers Whitney couldn't believe it first. A source said,</p><p>“She hit the roof when she got the divorce papers, she took a shovel out of the garage and started smashing the windows on the vehicles and slashing the tires on the vehicles in the compound.”</p><p>Their divorce got finalized in no time and both of them went their separate ways. Since then Big Smo is not in a relationship with someone.&nbsp;</p><h2>Quick facts about Big Smo</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/12/rszbigsmo-s1-bigsmo-castbio-688x1065.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><ul><li>Born John Lee Smith, on&nbsp;February 14, 1976 (age 41), in San Diego, California, U.S.</li><li>He is the son of&nbsp;Mary Jane Smith and&nbsp;Carl Avery Smith.</li><li>His father worked as a US Navy.</li><li>He started his career in 1999.</li><li>He released his debut album in&nbsp;Kuntry Kitchen with Yayoda Records in 2002.</li><li>In 2003-04, he released two albums <strong>Smo & Money Records</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Monument Society</strong>.</li><li>He released a self-titled named&nbsp;American Made in 2010.</li><li>His rap is generally focused on rural rap and Country themes.</li><li>His net worth is $3 million.</li></ul><p>For all the latest celeb gossip, make sure to follow our website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnyzrc%2BpnKtlkp60br%2FMqGSwmaNivK%2BvxGakmqqinrKledOoZKGho2LEqrLEZq6hsV2ZtqV506GcZqiRnr9uu8%2BtnJ1llqS%2FbrDIr6arm5ViuK%2B71maYm6elqXqptdJmp56qo6S7oriMpaCfnQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-apple-watch-complications.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 14 Best Apple Watch Complications Worth Using</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./italian-parties-agree-back-marini-president.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Italian parties agree to back Marini for president</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
