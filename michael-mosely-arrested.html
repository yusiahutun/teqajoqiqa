One of the men killed was singer Tucker Beathard's brother, Clayton, who was 22 years old.</p><p>Mosley was captured Wednesday afternoon in Ashland City, Tenn., according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. He was alone in a vacant home when law enforcement moved in and surrounded the house, resulting in his surrender.</p><p>Mosley landed at the top of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's most wanted list on Tuesday morning, with a $2,500 reward offered over his head. Mosley was identified by officials as a convicted felon with a violent history, including a separate stabbing incident in 2015 as well as a string of assault and burglary charges over the past few years.</p><p>According to Nashville's&nbsp;<a href=#>NewsChannel5</a>, police responded to a call at the Dogwood Bar on the 1900 block of Division Street shortly before 3AM on Saturday. Allegedly, "an unwanted advancement made by a man toward a woman in the bar," sparked a confrontation that began inside the bar and escalated into physical violence after it spilled over into the outside.</p><p>Clayton Beathard, 22, and Paul Trapeni III, 21, were transported to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where both men subsequently died. A third victim was released after receiving medical treatment.</p><p>Clayton Beathard was a high school football star who went on to play for&nbsp;<a href=#>Long Island University</a>. Brother Tucker is not the only musician in the family:&nbsp;Their&nbsp;father is Nashville songwriter Casey Beathard, who has written for artists including Gary Allen, Kenny Chesney, Eric Church and more.</p><p>The Beathard family is additionally well-represented in sports, with Clayton having had an impressive football pedigree. His other brother, C.J. Beathard, is a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. Their grandfather is NFL Hall of Famer Bobby Beathard, who won four Super Bowls as a general manager.</p><p><strong>Country Stars Who Have Suffered Terrible Tragedy</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpqGTna6muIympqydnK56or7RnqqtnZRk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-power-of-geographic-segmentation.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Power of Geographic Segmentation in Business Strategies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./article-bc7c738c-31e3-11ec-8323-2f626eba9d1c-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>South Mississippi Fair: What you need to know | Free News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
