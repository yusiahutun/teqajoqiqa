It is an act to show preference and be partial to another person or group. This preference can be manifested in different ways, like attention, affection, and allocation of resources. It is influenced by various factors and even situational circumstances, social dynamics and personal biases.</p><p>It includes several factors:</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Cognitive Biases</h5><p>They play a major role in the manifestation of favoritism. These shortcuts influence the way one perceives and interacts with other people, initiating favoritism in various ways:</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>1. Confirmation bias</h6><p>People collects and confirm their perceptions and beliefs. evidence when they feel that an individual or group is better or deserving favour.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>2. In-group bias</h6><p>It refers to the favouring of individuals belonging to one group in comparison with other groups. Ethnicity, nationality, and religion are some of the factors that lead to favoritism towards people of one group and discrimination against others.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>3. Attribution bias</h6><p>Many times, people make assumptions and stereotypes and like to make additions to other people’s behaviour. Even though there is a lack of evidence to support these assumptions, when someone is seen as a favourite and their actions are always linked with positive traits or intentions</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>4. Anchoring bias</h6><p>This occurs when making decisions. A person is more inclined to the first piece of information they receive. There is always a chance of contradicting opinion, if the information received belongs to someone who they perceive to be favourable.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Psychological Mechanism</h5><h6 class=wp-block-heading>1. Similarity</h6><p>Also known as the Similarity-attraction principle. People favour those whom they find similar to them in aspects of appearance, personality, values and interests. Most probably, there are two main reasons for this attraction. First is that they feel comfortable with them and feel that they can understand them better than anyone else. The second reason is that they feel more connected and find themselves a more reliable and trustworthy person.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>2. Proximity</h6><p>It is also known as the Proximity principle. People favour those with whom they are in close association either physically or emotionally. Since people have more opportunities to interact with people, they tend to develop strong relationships and a greater sense of like and trust.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>3. Power</h6><p>People do favouritism in order to maintain their power of control. For example, a student who excels in studies and manages to do all the tasks provided by the teacher within a stipulated time frame receives favourable treatment.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>4. Reciprocity</h6><p>It is also known as the Norm of reciprocity. Generally, people tend to return the favour to those who have done them any favours in the past. It’s a social norm which encourages people to follow the cycle.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Impact</h5><ul><li>Initiating conflicts, resentment, and jealousy leads to a disrupted and negative working environment.</li><li>Unfairness and business ultimately decrease productivity and morale.</li><li>Those who get favoured develop a sense of entitlement, arrogance, and a feeling of being better than others and keep relying on being the favourite of others, losing their own self-worth.</li><li>Those who are unpaired develop low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.</li></ul><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Tips to cope with favouritism</h5><ul><li>Focus on your own goals and accomplishments. Don’t be discouraged from pursuing your own dreams</li><li>Avoid comparing to others. Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses</li><li>Seek professional help if needed. Therapists can help in dealing with negative emotions.</li></ul><p>Favouritism cannot be eliminated, but understanding its nature and prevalence and taking steps to mitigate its impact can be done to make a fairer and more inclusive environment. Most of the time, people unconsciously become part of favouritism. Hence, everyone must try to accept and respect new viewpoints on a specific matter, work effectively and consider without being getting defensive, and try to make a safe environment where words can be expressed fully and people listen to each other with different perceptions.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Read More Articles:</h6><h6 class=wp-block-heading></h6><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Empowering Minds: Revolutionizing Teenage Mental Health in India</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Psychological First Aid (PFA): An Immediate Assistance to</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Unmasking Shadow: The Silent Battle of a Victim</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 28, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>“From being peaceful to into pieces”: The Inner</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 28, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Positive</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Aham Brahmasmi: Deciding Your Self-Image</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 27, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmraCVYr20xcKhpqWnl656o7HHoqWdZZaWw7C%2ByK2grKVf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./18-mind-blowing-facts-about-hillsborough-stadium.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>18 Mind-blowing Facts About Hillsborough Stadium</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./influencer-bares-body-candid-nude-25487153.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Influencer bares body in candid nude snap that celebrates 'loving yourself'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
