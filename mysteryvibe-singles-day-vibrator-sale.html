The main question on everyone’s mind? Why, Zayn, why? Well, now, over eight years later, the former boybander is ready to give fans a bit of closure by sharing his side of the story in detail for the first time — and he’s not holding back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Wednesday’s episode of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Call Her Daddy podcast</a>, Malik opened up about the split when chatting with host Alex Cooper during his first interview in more than six years. When prompted by Cooper to reflect on the moment he knew that it was “time to leave” One Direction, the singer shared that it partially had to do with group “politics” and his “competitive” nature.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think I’d known for a minute, but there was a lot of politics going on,” he began. “Certain people were doing certain things, certain people didn’t want to sign contracts, so I knew something was happening so I just got ahead of the curve. I was just like, ‘I’m just gonna get out of here. I think this is done.’”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, “I, completely selfishly, wanted to be the first person to go and make my own record. I was like, ‘I’m gonna jump the gun here for the first time.’ I’m a passive dude, but when it comes to my music and my business, I'm serious about it and I’m competitive. I wanted to be the first to go do my own thing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zayn then explained that being around his bandmates, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Harry Styles</a>, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Niall Horan</a>, 24/7 during their five years of touring also contributed to his departure.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There were obviously underlying issues within our friendships, too,” Malik revealed. “We’d been together every day for 5 years, and we got sick of each other if I’m being completely honest. We were close, you know, we’d done crazy things with each other that nobody else in the world will ever understand. I look back on it now in a much fonder light than I would have as I’d just left.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elsewhere in the interview, the singer also touched on what he thought of his “bad boy” persona throughout his time in the band, adding, “They just said, ‘Oh yeah, you can be the mysterious one. That wasn’t necessarily my personality, I’m just chill. I know that a lot of people have high-energy personalities, and it’s just not the way I am.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But while fans may have had to wait several years to hear from Malik in an interview, he later assured fans that they won’t have to wait nearly as long for new music as his next single, “Love Like This,” is set to drop on July 21. “It’s just a summer jam. It’s a good vibe. It just feels like summer,” he shared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8yyqq2doq7Dqq7EZqqippehsrR5w5qwZq6Zl7%2BiwM6rZKyZnJo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-porter-dead-dies-diddy-puff-daddy-ex-girlfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Diddy's Ex-Girlfriend, Mother of His Kids, Kim Porter Found Dead at H</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zak-bagans.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zak Bagans - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Height, Career, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
