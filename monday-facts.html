The Old English word Monandaeg inherited this and passed it on to the Middle English word Monenday. From there, we have the modern English word Monday. Old English also influenced Germanic languages, with the Old German word Manetag leading to the modern German word Montag.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-3>Monday has a special history in Islam.</h2><p>For one thing, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Islamic</a> tradition dictates that the prophet Muhammad was actually born on a Monday. That same tradition also claims that he received the Quran from God on a Monday. Other traditions also record that the prophet regularly fasted on Mondays.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>Ucla Dunks</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-4>Scientists consider it less likely to rain on Mondays than on any other day of the week.</h2><p>The science behind it isn’t completely clear yet, though. The main working theory today is that Mondays carry less <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>pollution</a> over the weekend. This means less dust in the air, which can actually influence rainfall.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-5>There’s actually a Superman novel named Miracle Monday.</h2><p>Written by Eliott S. Magin, it was first published in 1981, as additional material to the Christopher Reeve series of Superman films. The novel involves Superman fighting a demon from hell who wanted to break Superman’s sense of morality.</p><p>Specifically, the demon wanted to force Superman into killing someone. In the end, Superman succeeds in banishing the demon back to hell, on the third Monday of May. This is what the novel’s name of Miracle Monday refers to. Witness the moral dilemma for yourself when you grab a copy <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-6>Several sporting and entertainment shows have specials on Monday nights in the USA.</h2><p>For one example, there’s Monday Night Football by the NFL, currently airing on ESPN. Another example is Monday Night Raw, produced by the WWE, which airs on the USA Network.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/postbox-15502_1920-730x487.jpg><h2 class=content-title id=title-7>Jesse Owens won the first of his historic gold medals on a Monday.</h2><p>Jesse Owens was a track-and-field athlete who competed for his native USA at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. He won 4 gold medals during the competition, and in doing so dashed Nazi Germany’s hopes of using the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Olympics</a> to trumpet white superiority on the world stage.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-8>The USA dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima on a Monday.</h2><p>On August 6th, 1945, the USA dropped a bomb that exploded with the force of 20,000 tons of TNT and killed between 90,000 to 150,000 people in Hiroshima. Along with the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki 3 days later, it forced <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Japan</a> to surrender to the Allies and ended WWII.</p><p>The decision to use <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>nuclear</a> weapons caused much debate on its ethics and necessity. However, historians generally agree that it saved more lives than it killed, as it made an actual invasion of Japan that would have killed millions of people unnecessary.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-9>Hershey Chocolate Company made the first kisses on a Monday.</h2><p>Almost everyone in the world knows about Hershey’s famous <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>chocolate</a> kisses. One of the sweeter Monday facts is that Hershey’s first made Kisses on the Monday of July 1st, 1907.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>Botas Vaqueras</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-10>Segregation became illegal on a Monday.</h2><p>On May 17th, 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled the segregation of schools based on skin color as unconstitutional. Naturally, this caused outrage from white supremacists, with many school principals refusing to follow the court’s order to desegregate campuses.</p><p>This, in turn, led to US President Dwight D. Eisenhower to order US troops to forcibly desegregate schools, and to escort colored students to schools for their own protection.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-11>YouTube became a reality on a Monday.</h2><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>YouTube</a> is such a huge part not just of the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>internet</a>, but of 21st century culture as a whole, which makes it hard to imagine a time when it didn’t exist. However, Youtube didn’t really become a reality until February 14th, 2005. On that day, YouTube’s domain came to life and has only grown and become a part of everyone’s life ever since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Monday-Facts.jpg><h3>Was this page helpful?</h3><p class=why-trust><span>Our commitment to delivering trustworthy and engaging content is at the heart of what we do.
