He is best known for being Javon Walton’s brother, but now he is also known for his performance on American Idol Season 20. It is too much essential for him to win this title because he even left his job so that he can only focus on musical careers and dreams. This decision made him stronger that’s for sure because he finally made his place in the top five contestants in the show.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Fritz was born in Tyler, Texas, in the United States of America in the year 2000 to Fritz Hager Jr. and Sarina Hager. His father formerly served as a chaplain in the Texas State Guard and as a member of the Tyler ISD School Board for six years. His mother is an accomplished attorney who works in the Tyler, Texas, area. Henry Hager and Jack Hager are two of his five siblings. He was praised by his parents for his talent and supported him.</p><p>His elder siblings provided him advice for which he was always grateful. Fritz completed his high school education at Robert E Lee High School. Since he was about 2 or 3 years old, he had a penchant for singing. Later, he went to Tyler Junior College to further his education. “The Singer of the College,” was his dubbed name given by his peers.</p><h3>Fritz Hager Career</h3><p>Fritz began singing from a young age. He is a member of the Tyler Civic Theater Center and has been in a number of productions, including West Side Story and Newsies. He announced the release of his debut EP on March 25. All My Friends, Maybe I Think I Love You, Second-Hand Friend, Inconsequential Love, and The Ocean are among Fritz’s hits. “I was sitting in my room, and I was trying to write another song, and I was thinking about the different kinds of reasons that make life difficult in our world,” Fritz explained.</p><p>I eventually whittled it down to the most serious issue: people. We are all capable of being nasty to one another, whether we are unforgiving or greedy. We must provide love to others, just as I wrote in the song.” He is now employed as a security officer. He claims to spend 12 hours a day watching cameras and sitting in a dark room. Fritz shot to fame after his American Idol audition video aired on ABC Network in March 2022. He is a competitor in the twenty-first season of American Idol, an American reality singing competition show.</p><h4>Social Media</h4><p>Fritz is currently active on Instagram, where he has 18.8k followers and 1,366 followings with 208 posts under the username @fritzhagermusic. Since August 2014, he has been active on Twitter under the handle @fritzhagermusic, where he has 1,023 followers and 95 followings. With his singing skills and brave decision to give it all to pursue his music dreams, he managed to build a strong and loyal fanbase.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Fritz Hager Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Frederick Hager III</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>2000</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2022)</td><td>22 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Tyler, Texas, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Songwriter</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Fritz-Hager-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 10” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 177 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 69 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 152 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>10 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Fritz Hager Jr.</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Sarina Hager</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Henry Hager, Jack Hager</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Tyler Junior College</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Fritz-Hager-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Girlfriend</td><td>None</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>According to rumors, Fritz Hager is presently dating Leah Marlene.
