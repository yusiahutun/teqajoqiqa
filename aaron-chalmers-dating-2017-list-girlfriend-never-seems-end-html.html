The Geordie hunk later tried to clarify the reason and told The Sun's Bizzare column:</p><p style=text-align:justify>“The story was laughable; everything that was said in the story was lies.

Two years&nbsp;after beginning their romantic journey, news of the couple's&nbsp;split quickly caught fire. Since they could not spark love with each other, they decided to part ways on 15 October 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-638 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Following the split, both Aaron and Talia unfollowed each other on Instagram. When it looked like Aaron would focus more on his fighting, he shocked the world with a piece of enormous news on his Twitter.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Posting a picture of ultrasound with some spare baby clothes on Twitter, the fighter announced being a daddy in the coming future. A few days after the breakup with his ex-girlfriend, the happy father announced the good news. A stepfather to her ex-girlfriend's daughter, Aaron&nbsp;was over the moon to be the father of his child.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-639 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Aaron Chalmers post picture of an ultrasound of his new baby in October 2019</strong> (Photo:&nbsp;Aaron Chalmer's Instagram)</p><p style=text-align:justify>As of now, the two have already parted ways, but seeing at the situation, the two might reconsider their decision and reconcile for the sake of the baby.&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>MMA Fights & Height</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Aaron, who has a commendable height of five feet &&nbsp;nine inches,&nbsp;also tried his luck in the event of BAMMA.

So, BAMMA said they don't want us to fight for them again, I won't fight for them again after what's happened, so it would just make sense to terminate the contract but for some reason, they're not releasing us."</p><p style=text-align:justify>With ongoing contract disputes, Aaron's fans all over the world couldn't wait for this court issue to end.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Returning to the octagon in February 2019, the former Geordie Shore star suffered his first-ever career defeat against&nbsp;Corey Browning.
