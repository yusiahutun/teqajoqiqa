"What is going on?"</p><p>Finally, he told her "your mom may or may not have videotaped you after surgery. And she gave us the video."</p><p>"For television?" Swift asked, still dumbfounded and now appearing somewhat horrified. Especially as it also seems certain Swift had never seen this footage before Jimmy shared it with an audience of millions.</p><p>And it is absolutely glorious, with Swift all bandaged up and struggling to tear off a banana from a bunch, only to declare, "That wasn't the one I wanted," when a different one broke off.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:298e4e14-1b1b-5761-84d2-87cc5ea374f2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:52bd238d-c6b9-5ab6-bc15-b1929f50124c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/59/5by4/2019/09/26/59c683049d1b56d0a46d3d705a26d24e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Scooter Braun Hits Back at Taylor Swift: 'It's Not Based on Any Truth'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>And this was a huge deal, as Taylor started to cry -- a post-lasik no-no -- and even worried what would happen to that banana if she ate the other one, because "it doesn't have a head!"</p><p>It was all too much for Fallon, who had to leave his desk he was laughing so hard, while Taylor just sat there, dumbfounded that she was just <strong><a href=#>"David-After-Dentist"</a></strong>-ed by her own mom!</p><p>"She was kind enough to drive me there, but cruel enough to film it and give it to you!" Taylor said, clearly still in shock. In fact, when he tried to move on to talking about her album, Taylor just couldn't make the transition.</p><p>"I can't even be mad," she finally concluded. "I'm just impressed that you infiltrated my family."</p><p>Elsewhere in the show, Taylor joined Jimmy for an epic battle of musical knowledge, and she proved perhaps his toughest competitor ever. The game is incredibly difficult because The Root play the track only one instrument at a time, so you might have to guess it by the drum beat or bass line only as it starts.</p><p>Taylor also inadvertently revealed both her favorite song and the first one she learned to play on guitar. Wait, were The Roots giving her a tactical advantage?</p><p>Regardless, we were absolutely blown away with Taylor's depth of musical knowledge, and she truly gave Jimmy a run for his money, even knowing one of his right answers. And yet, the whole game ended in what Jimmy called "my favorite thing that ever happened on the whole show ever."</p><p>Yeah, there's no way we're going to spoil what it was, because it was absolutely masterful after the way the game progressed. Trust us, you'll want to check it out for yourself ... and see if you can get any of the answers before they do. This game is hard!</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
