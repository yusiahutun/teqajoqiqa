And after years spent under the control and abuse of Fred Waterford, she finally got her revenge. So what happens next?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the Season 4 finale of The Handmaid's Tale, June tastes sweet vengeance when she and a number of women corner Fred in the woods and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a36739814/handmaids-tale-nolite-te-bastardes-carborundorum-meaning/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="beat him to death" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">beat him to death</a>. The next morning, her husband, Luke, finds June bloodied and distraught in her daughter Nichole's room. He doesn't seem to know exactly what she did, but knows that it can't be good. Luke doesn't say anything, but June can already start to guess what he's thinking.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I know. I'm sorry," she whispers to him. "Just give me five minutes, okay? Just give me five minutes with her, then I'll go."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But where, exactly, will June go? And why does she have to leave?</p><img alt="handmaid's tale" title="handmaid's tale" width=3000 height=1996 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tht-ep410-d7-sg-0028rt-1-1623865983.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hulu</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One possibility is that she may have to answer for killing Fred in the woods of No Man's Land, but showrunner Bruce Miller wants to emphasize that June's exit, if she goes through with it, would be her own decision.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I very much want it to be her choice, not consequences," Miller told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2021/tv/features/handmaids-tale-season-4-finale-death-1234988541/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Variety</a>. "Because once it's consequences, it's just her dealing with those consequences. And of course, there will be that [down the line], but right now, there's no crime. Nobody has any idea what happened. Fred's gone; he was traded."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's also possible that she doesn't go at all. When the episode ends, June is still fresh from her long-awaited reckoning. "Well, I don't know if she's gonna leave. She feels like she has to," Miller told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/tv/the-handmaids-tale-showrunner-season-4-finale/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Weekly" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">June's choice to pursue vengeance "makes sense character-wise," Elisabeth Moss, who plays the anti-heroine, told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/handmaids-tale-season-finale-elisabeth-moss-june-fred-1234968048/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. She added jokingly, "What is the show if she doesn't choose revenge; she lives happily ever after in the Three's Company house with Nichole?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even after escaping Gilead, June is still very much living with trauma, Moss explained. As June tells Emily in the finale, she couldn't just let that go so easily. "She has been changed too much," Moss told THR. "Her life is this war on Gilead and that's her purpose in life. There's nothing else that can be done."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That closing scene captures "her changing from June as a handmaid in Gilead to June as an avenger with more choices but more responsibility," Miller told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2021/06/handmaids-tale-spoilers-season-finale-recap-joe-fiennes-bruce-miller-death-elisabeth-moss-hulu-1234774835/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Deadline class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Deadline</a>.</p><img alt="handmaid's tale" title="handmaid's tale" width=2704 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tht-ep410-d7-sg-0045rt-1623869215.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hulu</span><p>O-T Fagbenle as Luke, capturing all our reactions to the Handmaid’s Tale Season 4 finale.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Luke seems to have sensed a deep change in June too. "The image of Luke when he sees June with Fred's blood on her face as he falls against the wall is haunting," executive producer Warren Littlefield told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danafeldman/2021/06/16/the-handmaids-tale-season-4-finale-why-it-ended-the-way-it-did/?sh=593e5e821f88" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Forbes class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Forbes</a>. "He's essentially saying, 'Holy f**k, look what she's turned into!' He knows at that moment who she is now."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Miller told Entertainment Weekly that Luke's emotional response in those final moments plays off a recent flashback. "I think based on the episode before where her flashback with Luke says, 'I'll love whatever you become. Don't worry, I love whatever you turn into.' In this moment, she's saying, 'Yeah, remember when he said that? This is obviously not true. So I'll go.' But he may come back and say, 'No, no, no, no.'"<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Whatever is in store for June, Luke, and the rest of the crew will have to wait until The Handmaid's Tale <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a34950711/the-handmaids-tale-season-5-news-date-cast-spoilers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="returns for Season 5" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">returns for Season 5</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGiemaG6bsDVaJhsbmdpf3h%2Bj2ifmqaUoq6qsNJmq5qklWLApq3SqKVmbF2au6W1zaBknrCgoa6qusSdZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./20-asias-top-style-and-beauty-influencers-where.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>20 of Asias top style and beauty influencers where they go, fashion follows</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mohsen-namjoo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Mohsen Namjoo dating?
