But it’s not very easy, you can’t just say stop him and send him on the plane and send him overseas to retire.</p><p>“I think you have to keep working him, make him happy, progressively drop him [down in work] and decide to retire, something like that.”</p><p>Lui said Golden Sixty thrived in his stable rather than being sent to a paddock for a break.</p><p>“We’ll keep him in the stable for a while,” the veteran handler said. “Actually, even if we decided not to run him, we can keep him in the stable and just make him happy.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/30/4dcffbd9-0858-4d84-b210-d25a82bb3824_0699eb27.jpg data-fid=14998929 data-resolution=1 width=2000 height=1247 title="Golden Sixty in action winning the Hong Kong Mile in December 2023." alt="Golden Sixty in action winning the Hong Kong Mile in December 2023." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Despite Sunday’s deflating defeat in his return from a minor leg injury sustained in January, Golden Sixty returned to warm applause from his legion of fans at Sha Tin.</p><p>The eight-year-old has struggled on rain-affected tracks in the past, including a third to Russian Emperor in the Group One Gold Cup (2,000m) in 2022 on yielding ground.</p><p>“The weather didn’t help him, as well as the ground,” Lui said. “He was OK after the race. Of course he got beaten, so he’s not happy.</p><p>“You can see the two big races he got beat, he got beat by Douglas Whyte’s horse [Russian Emperor] on soft ground and the [2022 Stewards’ Cup], the official rating was good going but it was a wet track. He got beat by John Size’s horse, Waikuku.”</p><p>Golden Sixty has broken records and taken Lui, Chan and jockey Vincent Ho Chak-yiu on the ride of a lifetime in his 26 wins from 31 starts.</p><p>The world’s highest-rated galloper accumulated a record HK$167 million in prize money, joined Rapper Dragon as the only gallopers to win all three legs of the Classic Series in 2020 and won a record-tying three Hong Kong Miles.</p><p>“He’s a horse that’s once in a lifetime,” Lui said.</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH6VaW9wbl%2BowrGx0ayrmqpdnK6tuM6pnKtll6S5pbHNZqqisKSuwG6y1K2sq51dp7KurcinqmaZmad6orLTnqlmm5iWurG1zqeqZqWZobJusMSfnJqs</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amy-adams-helps-daughter-aviana-take-instrument-to-music-class.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amy Adams Adorably Helps Daughter Aviana Carry Her Instrument on Her Way to Music Lessons</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./micaiah-maraj-is-one-of-nicki-minajs-three-brothers-meet-him.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Micaiah Maraj Is One of Nicki Minaj's Three Brothers: Meet Him</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
