Piscean people are dreamers, healers, and sometimes even escapists who are frequently swept up in fantasy. That mystical tone is owed to the sign's ruler, Neptune, which oversees illusion and spirituality — and has a way of clouding rational thought and encouraging us to look at the world through rose-colored glasses. And those are all just a few of the themes that you could feel influencing your perspective in the days around this month's Pisces-ruled lunar event.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Fish's annual full moon will be exact on Saturday, September 10 at 6 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT. With the moon connecting harmoniously to Uranus, the planet of sudden change and innovation, this late summer moment might very well play host to out-of-the-blue breakthroughs and spiritual growth.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-full-moon-in-pisces-invites-you-to-step-back-from-reality></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>The full moon in Pisces invites you to step back from reality.</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Full moons — which happen when the confident sun exactly opposes the intuitive moon — always present a monthly opportunity to wrap up projects you started six months or even two weeks prior. They're culmination points, breaking points, and a chance to release anything that's no longer serving you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And with this month's full moon falling in daydreamy, deeply feeling Pisces — which is also the final sign of the 12-sign zodiac cycle — you could truly feel as though you're at the end of a significant chapter in your life and on the precipice of a new one. You could be especially sensitive, compassionate, and find it easier to pick up on other people's vibes. Still, caring for yourself — and respecting whatever's happening in the most tender, vulnerable part of your heart — will be the top priority.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's a lesson that we've already been called to learn during service-oriented, intuitive Virgo season. But while Virgoan energy nudges us to take practical steps to nurture others and ourselves, Piscean vibes are about diving into the deep end of challenging emotions. Given the Fish's propensity for healing and exploring spirituality, being brave enough to swim in these challenging waters can prove truly cathartic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In other words, full moons are super-emotional moments in and of themselves, and when the full moon is ruled by Pisces, anything you're feeling is bound to be intensified.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-moons-sextile-to-uranus-brings-sudden--ideally-positive--twists-and-turns></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>The moon's sextile to Uranus brings sudden — ideally, positive — twists and turns.</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the moon falling at 17 degrees Pisces, it'll form a sweet sextile to revolutionary Uranus, currently residing at 18 degrees of earth sign Taurus. These two signs make a naturally cozy pair; they're the duo who spent the holiday weekend blasting A/C, cuddling up on the couch, digging into a pint of ooey-gooey decadent ice cream, and watching Persuasion on Netflix for the second time. But we're talking about the moon dancing with Uranus, and even when it's in steady, fixed Taurus, Uranus brings electrifying change and lightbulb moments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All those deeply-felt emotions that could be coming up for you around this full moon could lead to an exciting epiphany, desire to move in a totally new direction or strike out against convention. It's an inspiring, enlivening aspect that can bring thrills and surprises to an already magical time.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-plutos-involvement-could-drive-you-to-step-into-your-intuitive-power></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Pluto's involvement could drive you to step into your intuitive power.</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before the moon completes its run through Pisces, it'll also form a sextile to Pluto, the planet of rebirth, regeneration, power, and transformation. This signals an opportunity to shed light on anything that's been lurking under the surface and to contend with emotions that you might not have been ready or willing to deal with until now. And as if a full moon in Pisces wasn't already such a super-psychic moment itself, the moon's sextile to powerful Pluto pumps up your ability to tap into your intuition.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In short, this is a full moon that's all about going inward, stepping away from the desire for external validation, and tending to whatever's going on in your heart of hearts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, how this Pisces full moon will affect you, based on your sign. (Pro-tip: Be sure to read both your sun and your rising sign, if you know it.

Uranus in your eighth house of emotional bonds may encourage you to lean on a loved one to map out what comes next.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scorpio (October 23-November 21)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This full moon is in your fifth house of romance and self-expression, so it can be a truly fun, lighthearted, creatively stimulating, and even steamy one for you.
