Derek and Julianne and their other three siblings, Sharee, Marabeth, and Katherine Hough grew up in Utah.</p><p>According to Taste of Country, Julianne and Derek have a history of dancing; their parents met while competing on a collegiate ballroom dance team, and their grandparents were dancers. Furthermore, musicians Riker, Rydel, Rocky, Ryland Lynch, and Ross Lynch from R5 and The Driver Era are the second cousins of Derek and Julianne.</p><p>During their teenage years, amid their parents’ divorce, Derek and Julianne were sent to live in London with dance instructors Corky and Shirley Ballas. Corky and Shirley are the parents of fellow DWTS pro-Mark Ballas, who was in Derek’s wedding party and is still close to the Houghs. Derek and Julianne studied music, drama, and several dance styles at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts while they were residing in London.</p><p>Later, Mark, Julianne, and Derek established the pop music trio 2B1G (“2 Boys, 1 Girl”), who competed in dance competitions around the US and UK.</p><p>Back to Marriann and Bruce, they are no longer married. Super-close star siblings Derek and Julianne Hough discussed their parents’ “difficult” divorce in their People cover story. Now, RadarOnline.com can exclusively divulge information about the heartbreaking breakup. Marriann and Bruce pledged to stay committed to their four young children in their formal divorce order, which was written in March 1998, when Julianne was just 9 years old and Derek was 12 years old.</p><p>“The parties both have loving and valuable relationships with their children, and agree to work together to support those relationships,” Utah court documents state. “Further, the parties agree to work together to provide for the physical care and financial and emotional support of the children.”</p><p>The marriage reportedly ended in 1998.</p><p>Talking about Bruce, Bruce is the managing director of Hough Management, LLC, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before this, he was the president of Nutraceutical, a 1993-founded nutritional supplement firm. He has also endorsed President Donald Trump for reelection in the past, according to Park Record, and he is a member of the Republican National Committee.</p><p>There were fewer than 15,000 people living in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, the charming lake town where Bruce was born, at the time. In lieu of his hometown of Hollywood, California, Hough’s father, a radio announcer without a high school education, had chosen to relocate there for two reasons: first, he loved to fish, and second, he believed that rural northern Idaho was a better place for him and his wife to raise their five children.</p><p>Bruce&nbsp;attended Ricks College, which is now Brigham Young University-Idaho, after serving a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Central America. There, he competed in ballroom dancing alongside Mariann, his future wife. Sharee, the first of their five children, was soon to be born and the couple were married.</p><h3><strong>Is Marriann Hough Still Married To Bruce?</strong></h3><p>No, Marriann Hough and Bruce Hough are no longer married. Bruce is married to his current wife Debra Hough. Whereas, Marriann is married to her current husband Aaron Nelson, a financial consultant. With four more children from a prior marriage, Aaron’s blended family now had nine children overall. The family of eleven moved into a 4,000-square-foot house in Las Vegas in 1999, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p><p>On Aaron’s birthday, Marriann wished her husband, “Cheers to Aaron’s favorite drink… chocolate milk…. Happy birthday to my Libra Buddha Baby…my best friend…my peaceful warrior…my unselfish, quiet, exemplary full of wisdom… Bestie… WAHOO<span class="x3nfvp2 x1j61x8r x1fcty0u xdj266r xhhsvwb xat24cr xgzva0m xxymvpz xlup9mm x1kky2od">“</span></p><h3><strong>Marriann Hough Age</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Marriann Hough reached 66 years old.
