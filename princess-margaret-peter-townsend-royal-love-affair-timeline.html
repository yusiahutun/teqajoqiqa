Their resulting romance came at a time when marrying a divorcé was not only frowned upon, but also forbidden by the Church of England. And since Margaret was not yet 25 years old, she required marriage approval from her sister, the queen, who ultimately refused to give it on account of the captain's marital history.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, Margaret's love for a time transcended royal agendas, and she continued her romance with Townsend for several more years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead, see the historical overview of Margaret and Townsend's tempestuous love story, from its sweet beginnings to its heartbreaking end.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1947: They meet.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A married Townsend meets then-teenager Margaret for the first time while accompanying the royal family on a three-month tour to South Africa. His duty was to protect the princess throughout the trip, so the two spent a lot of time together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In later years, Margaret <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5216399/Did-Princess-Margarets-lover-sleep-17.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=reportedly class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">reportedly</a> tells a confidante, "We rode together every morning in that wonderful country, in marvelous weather. That's when I really fell in love with him."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Townsend also accompanies Margaret on a trip to Belfast in October, and he requests to have his room at Hillsborough Castle moved next to hers.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">November 1952: Townsend divorces his wife.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following 11 years of marriage and two young boys, Townsend officially divorces his wife, Rosemary Pratt, Marchioness Camden, in order to commit to Margaret.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">April 1953: Townsend proposes to Margaret.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Townsend asks Margaret for her hand in marriage, but they are unable to wed due to the 1772 Royal Marriages Act, which required that Parliament approve the marriage if the woman was under the age of 25. Margaret does not receive approval from the queen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The two still remain engaged, however, and continue their relationship in private.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">June 2, 1953: Rumors of their affair emerge at the queen's coronation.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite dating in secret for several years, rumors of their romance first circulate from their attendance at the queen's coronation, following the death of King George the previous year. As depicted in The Crown's first season, onlookers observe subtle suggestive exchanges between the two during the occasion—and per one reporter, Margaret is seen fixing up Townsend's shirt, spurring tabloid headlines speculating on the affair.</p><img alt="princess margaret" title="Princess Margaret" width=2424 height=3346 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/princess-margaret-at-the-british-industries-fair-at-olympia-news-photo-1668552176.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Keystone</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">August 21, 1955: Margaret turns 25.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Margaret reaches the pivotal age of 25, making her eligible to freely choose whether—and now, whom—to marry.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Due to amendments made preemptively by the queen and Parliament in the Royal Marriages Act in light of Margaret and Townsend's potential marriage, Margaret would now be exempt from the Church of England's rules prohibiting a marriage with a divorcé insofar as she is removed from the line of succession, in which she stood third behind nephew Prince Charles and niece Princess Anne.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Exclusion from the Succession would not entail any other change in Princess Margaret's position as a member of the Royal Family," <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38032464 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="per Prime Minister Anthony Eden" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">per Prime Minister Anthony Eden</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite these newfound freedoms, Margaret remains apart from Townsend for two years while he's stationed abroad in Brussels to serve as an air attaché. She tells Eden in a letter that she would need to meet him face-to-face again in order to arrive at her final decision.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It is only by seeing him in this way that I feel I can properly decide whether I can marry him or not," she writes.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">October 31, 1955: Margaret announces the end of her engagement with Townsend.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The princess ultimately decides to end her relationship with Townsend to maintain her place in the royal line of succession.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an official statement released on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/31/newsid_3202000/3202307.stm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="BBC Radio" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">BBC Radio</a>, she announces, "I have been aware that, subject to my renouncing my rights of succession, it might have been possible for me to contract a civil marriage. But, mindful of the Church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Twenty-three years later, in 1978, Townsend releases his autobiography, Time and Chance, in which he expresses his ultimate peace with Margaret's decision.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She could have married me only if she had been prepared to give up everything—her position, her prestige, her privy purse," he writes. "I simply hadn't the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have lost."</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1959–60: They both marry other people.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Townsend marries Marie-Luce Jamagne in 1959. And one year later, on May 6, Margaret marries photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, who later becomes the Earl of Snowdon. Margaret and Jones eventually divorce in 1978 due to their extramarital affairs, but maintain a friendship up until the end of Margaret's life in February 2002.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ef84b592-a2b0-47e0-8e6c-e29e8d3ddc25_1619719162.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Sabrina Park" title="Headshot of Sabrina Park" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sabrina Park is a Digital Fellow at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HarpersBAZAAR.com</a> where she covers news, fashion, and culture stories.
