The verdict here will decide whether she'll be sent to prison or -- if found not responsible -- a mental health institution.</p><p>The first person to take the stand in her defense was her father, Arturo Coronado, who testified while wearing an orange jumpsuit from jail. During his testimony, he said the death of Taylor's mother in 2009 took a toll on her. He also noted that his son, Taylor's brother, died last year.</p><p>When asked whether her behavior changed after her mother's death, Coronado said she was "a little rambunctious" but was "a pretty normal kid." Though he noted she "got in trouble a little bit in school," he also said it was "nothing major."</p><p>At one point, he asked asked whether he ever reviewed any of her medical records. As the prosecution objected, Schabusiness made a hand gesture toward her father -- appearing to say "I love you" via sign language. She also appeared to smile, smirk and laugh throughout his testimony.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Coronado later testified that his daughter spent time in a psychiatric center because she "wasn't in the right state of mind." He also said she has been put on medications for treatment in the past -- and added he had concerns about her physical and mental health "always."</p><p>During cross-examination, he said she was "going really well" until her husband got out of jail -- something he said "turned everything upside down" due to meth use. He said they used meth and heroin, calling them "pretty bad" drugs.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:37f792d6-dc33-4abd-80f4-7297c550a3a9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:011acdaa-037e-442e-9487-18b44a797cc0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bb/5by4/2023/07/26/bb4f88defab949c2b3c683f973e35035_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Law&Crime</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Accused Killer Exclaims 'I Got Lazy,' Says She 'Forgot' Lover's Decapitated Head In Grisly Interrogation Video</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"The kid was already doing that s--- before and just a f---ing loser and he got my daughter involved in that s---," he added.
