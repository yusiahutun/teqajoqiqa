A quintessential cold-weather staple, beanies lend a layer of warmth to our heads and ears as we take on the elements and are versatile enough to be paired with all of our outerwear favorites, from our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>puffiest parkas</a> to our sleekest trench coats.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Today's beanie offering includes a seemingly infinite range of fabrics, silhouettes, and colors to suit various needs and tastes, whether you prefer a chunky rib knit with some room and stretch or a skull-hugging fisherman style. And with plenty of luxury options on the market — think super-soft cashmere and statement-making designer pieces — this humble winter hat has been taken to new sartorial heights. Needless to say, it can be quite a feat to sift through them all to find the ones that perfectly marry style and function. That’s why we tapped a team of style experts to help us determine which ones are actually worth it — keeping varying preferences and budgets in mind, of course.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-sunday-best-snowflake-beanie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sunday Best Snowflake Beanie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sunday Best Snowflake Beanie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FhokGIG0Dr5hhg9ercFz3RsfydI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sunday-best--snowflake-beanie-60700f637a974724aff0cc4daa59c957.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aritzia</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The design and fabrication make this beanie a warm, durable, and stylish choice.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It might fit too large for those who prefer snug beanies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re giving top honors to this simple beanie from Aritzia’s in-house Sunday Best brand because it checks all of our boxes: It’s warm, it’s soft, and it’s cute.

Fabrication-wise, it’s crafted from a super-soft double-layer material consisting of synthetics like acrylic, polyester, and nylon in addition to wool, while the brim also includes elastane. In layman's terms, it boasts a perfect blend of durability, warmth, and stretch that’ll last you for winters to come. Lastly, it’s available in 16 different shades to satisfy a variety of different tastes, from neutral creams, grays, and black to pretty-yet-subdued reds, purples, and blues.

Embroidered with the brand’s signature emoji patch, it lends a subtle nod to logomania without being too literal. Shopbop’s fashion director Caroline Maguire is a fan of this style, stating that she loves how the oversized shape style sits on her head, justifying the higher price tag. Moreover, she notes that this particular shade of gray is the perfect neutral to work into your winter wardrobe. However, if color is more your thing, you can also nab the style in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">few pastel hues</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Wool | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Care: </strong>Hand wash or dry clean</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-uniqlo-heattech-ribbed-beanie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Uniqlo Ribbed Beanie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UNIQLO HEATTECH Ribbed Beanie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qkDGuYNn0nKtugOn2Xas1pzvpfw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/uniqlo-heattech-ribbed-beanie-83f8d2d5a0c94647af290c97831c046b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>UNIQLO</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This beanie is fabricated with the brand’s HEATTECH technology to keep you extra warm.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It fits slightly snug, which may not be ideal for those with thick or curly hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When winter weather rolls around, we can always rely on Uniqlo’s HEATTECH to keep us extra warm without the added bulk, and this beanie is no exception. It’s made from a unique moisture-wicking nylon blend that converts the body’s moisture into heat and also prevents said heat from escaping, keeping your head nice and toasty despite its lightweight appearance.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From a style perspective, it’s slightly fitted, making it a great option for those who prefer their beanies to be on the snugger side (but not as tight as a fisherman style). The knit was thoughtfully designed to have narrower ribs along its cuff for a more comfortable fit, while the rib width at the top of the hat was recently updated from past iterations to ensure a better fit. Plus, its well-curated 10-shade selection will suit different preferences and tastes. Most importantly, it won’t break the bank, making this a smart purchase for the cold months ahead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Acrylic, nylon, wool, and spandex | <strong>Colors: </strong>10 | <strong>Care: </strong>Machine wash cold on a gentle cycle or dry clean</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-ribbed-ganni-rib-knit-beanie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Ribbed</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ganni Rib Knit Beanie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ganni Rib Knit Beanie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dlqIU1ZLNUG1-2L8bslEeHXb-fI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ganni--rib-knit-beanie-4a6ecd610d2a40f19429357ba162b31c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This beanie is made with a blend of recycled materials.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s only available in light colors.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a versatile beanie that’s warm yet doesn’t look bulky, look no further than this option from Ganni. Sure, it’s a pretty classic, no-frills style, featuring mid-sized ribbing and a logo tag on the cuff, but that’s exactly what makes it a great option for every day. It can be seamlessly worked into just about any winter ensemble, meaning you’ll get a lot of bang for your buck.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, it’s functional, too. It’s made from a blend of wool and polyamide, deeming it both warm and stretchy, but what makes this beanie stand out is its use of recycled materials: it’s constructed with 60 percent recycled wool and 7 percent recycled polyamide, so you can feel good about what it’s made of. It’s available in four pastel hues, though we’d love to see it in a few darker options, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled wool, wool, polyamide, recycled polyamide, and other fibers | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Care: </strong>Hand wash</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cashmere-jcrew-brushed-cashmere-beanie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cashmere</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Brushed Cashmere Beanie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="J.Crew Brushed Cashmere Beanie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Yg-_rVRAOT7L6NsQZNdgcbL-b9I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jcrew-brushed-cashmere-beanie--31bf77d096884edcbef8edf71a87cdd6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J.Crew</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This brushed cashmere beanie is exceptionally soft.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The light colorways are more prone to stains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cashmere is famed for its insulating capabilities and supreme softness — two things we want from our cold-weather accessories, especially when we’re battling the elements outdoors. Hence, the popularity of cashmere beanies. This J.Crew style is even softer than the norm due to being crafted with brushed cashmere yarn, resulting in a luxurious hand feel that counts stylist Ashley Dorough as a fan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It has a slightly roomy fit with a wide ribbed-knit band to ensure it stays in place all day long, which all hair types can appreciate.

Not only is it naturally insulating and warm, but it’s also quite breathable and body temperature-regulating — meaning you won’t overheat the second you step indoors. That said, if you’re seeking a cozy knit that won’t make you sweat, this 100 percent wool Loeffler Randall beanie is where it’s at.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Knit with an extra-chunky ribbed design, it’s literally “hygge” in beanie form; plus, it boasts a super-cute pom-pom on top if that’s your thing.

That’s where this beanie from Coach comes in, with a print that’s subtle enough not to overpower the rest of your look and perfect for tip-toeing into the academia trend. Designed with an extra-wide cuff adorned with varsity-inspired stripes, it adds a bit of excitement to an otherwise classic design. It’s made from a blend of acrylic and wool, meaning you get the best of both worlds: the durability of acrylic and the softness and warmth of wool. Also nice? 25 percent of this blend comes from recycled materials.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Acrylic, wool, and recycled acrylic | <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Care: </strong>Machine wash, then dry flat</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-color-options-los-angeles-apparel-classic-cuff-beanie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Color Options</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Los Angeles Apparel Classic Cuff Beanie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Los Angeles Apparel Classic Cuff Beanie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0ZrhThGPStg0Y6ZinNbMbq9mVvU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/los-angeles-apparel-classic-cuff-beanie-6dc7b4399144497abb41cb500adc458a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Los Angeles Apparel</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This beanie is available in a wide variety of colors, ranging from neutrals to neons.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Its fabrication isn’t very breathable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Los Angeles Apparel is renowned for its wide array of wardrobe basics in an even wider array of colorways. Case in point? This beanie offered in a whopping 36 different shades. Its color offering encompasses a little bit of everything — light-to-dark neutrals, vibrant jewel tones, and punchy neons — and with a price point at the lower end of the spectrum, you can shop a variety of shades to work into your winter wardrobe, guilt-free. We also love that everything from the brand is made in the United States.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind: It’s made from 100 percent acrylic, which has its pros and cons.

However, it’s made from a wool and alpaca blend that ensures great warmth and insulation, in addition to a super-soft hand feel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">More importantly, we love that it’s made with the well-being of animals and our planet in mind.

To avoid ending up with hat hair or a flattened blowout, your ideal beanie should be roomy and lightly stretch with your head. This Free People beanie does just that, thanks to the small amount of spandex in its fabrication. “Because it has some give to it, it won’t fit too snug, no matter your hair type,” says fashion stylist Julie Parladé, a stylist for Free People, who counts this beanie as one of her favorite styles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to the great fit, the ribbed fabrication and exaggerated cuff deem this style cozy, but still lightweight enough to wear in cool (not frigid) temperatures without breaking a forehead sweat. What’s more, it comes in eight colorways that span subdued neutrals and poppy brights, while marled yarns add a little depth and texture to each shade.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, acrylic, nylon, and spandex | <strong>Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Care: </strong>Not listed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-statement-lele-sadoughi-pearly-snowflake-rib-knit-beanie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Statement</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lele Sadoughi Pearly Snowflake Rib Knit Beanie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lele Sadoughi Pearly Snowflake Rib Knit Beanie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ox1-UVVWjUftHeZ42rEHGJGK75s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lele-Sadoughi-Pearly-Snowflake-Rib-Knit-Beanie-89c5691d366149a19e80720583865e78.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Faux pearl embellishments add a fun sartorial twist to an otherwise simple style.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not as warm as it may look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beanies may be a cold-weather staple, but that certainly doesn’t mean they need to fall into the basics category — take this beaded option from hair accessories maven Lele Sadoughi, for example. Embellished with faux acrylic pearl “snowflakes,” this hat is dopamine dressing in hat form, adding a fun sartorial twist to an otherwise classic silhouette. Even so, it doesn’t feel as glitzy as rhinestones or sequins, making it a little easier to style with both daytime and nighttime looks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Warmth-wise, the viscose- and acrylic-blend fabric won’t trap in heat as well as its wool counterparts, so despite its cozy appearance, it might not be the best option for a below-freezing morning commute. Also important to remember: Because it's embellished, it should be handled more delicately, especially while packing away in your tote bag or hand washing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Viscose, acrylic | <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Care: </strong>Hand wash<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plush-madewell-fuzzy-luxe-beanie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Fuzzy Luxe Beanie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell Fuzzy Luxe Beanie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Y2ciB3-tf1Zib5szu6R86bxr_Yo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-fuzzy-luxe-beanie-f284577574274131aa886f2ee62fa37b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The brushed finish makes the beanie extremely soft.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It needs to be line-dried and can’t be thrown in the dryer.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A beanie so cozy, you could sleep in it. As the name implies, this minimalist style from Madewell has the most luxuriously fuzzy hand feel thanks to its super-soft brushed finish — and it’s also as warm and toasty as it looks. It’s constructed with an acrylic blend that includes alpaca and wool, so you can trust it’ll provide all the insulation and warmth needed to navigate winter’s frigid temperatures without feeling too heavy. What’s more, it contains elastane and features a subtly ribbed cuff for added stretch, ensuring a super comfortable fit. It also comes in a few different colors — we’re partial to this sunny chartreuse iteration, but it’s also offered in cream and navy if you prefer something a little more subtle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Acrylic, polyamide, alpaca, wool, and elastane | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Care: </strong>Hand wash, then line dry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fisherman-patagonia-fishermans-rolled-beanie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fisherman</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Patagonia Fisherman's Rolled Beanie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Patagonia Fisherman's Rolled Beanie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bZXhiGYhbUspOyW1QfkMcUMxf6U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Patagonia-Fishermans-Rolled-Beanie-14254c8e094f4f05af59efc323bb1bd6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Patagonia</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s made from 100 percent recycled materials.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This style is slightly longer than your typical fisherman beanie.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you prefer a low-profile beanie to a floppy or tall style, this fisherman beanie from Patagonia is a solid choice. Fitted snug to the head and laying just over the ears, it’ll keep you warm — and is guaranteed to do so comfortably, thanks to its 100 percent recycled polyester yarn construction that’s skin-friendly and itch-free. There’s also the sustainability factor: In addition to being fully made from recycled materials, it’s also made in a Fair Trade Certified factory. Not surprising, given that sustainability is Patagonia’s modus operandi.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s worth noting that this design is slightly longer and less fitted than typical fisherman-style beanies, which could be considered a pro or con, depending on your personal preference. Traditional fisherman styles only cover the top of the ears, if at all — however, as one reviewer commented, you can easily achieve the classic look by rolling the cuff one extra time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled polyester yarn | <strong>Colors: </strong>7 | <strong>Care: </strong>Not listed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-chunky-anthropologie-chunky-knit-two-tone-beanie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Chunky</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anthropologie Chunky Knit Two-Tone Beanie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anthropologie Chunky Knit Two-Tone Beanie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/V-o9c1opQ1NoKbYurgxCukn3MJg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anthropologie-chunky-knit-two-tone-beanie-dd12f9405a9849cab5d56b77724db80c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The two-tone pattern adds an interesting element without looking too busy.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It sits very tall on the head, which might be an issue for some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Simply put, this one is peak cozy. Boasting an XXL ribbed cuff and a roomier-than-average fit, Anthropologie’s spin on the chunky knit beanie is the embodiment of warmth. It’s made from a blend of polyester and acrylic, meaning it has both heat-retaining and breathable properties, ensuring you stay toasty but never sweaty — a must for anyone who constantly moves from outdoors to indoors. Comfort aside, it’s also quite the statement piece. The chunkiness alone makes this beanie stand out, but the unique two-tone knit adds an interesting design element that can still be seamlessly styled with whatever winter coat you choose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, acrylic | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Care: </strong>Hand wash</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fabric</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fabric — both the type and weight — is crucial to consider when beanie shopping, but first and foremost, you’ll need to figure out its purpose. “Is it for fashion or function, or both?” asks Parladé. “If the goal is purely as an outfit accentuator, a lighter weight beanie — like cotton or something loose with a bit more give — can be worn all day without feeling tight or causing you to overheat. If utility is the objective, a thicker beanie made of wool or acrylic like Free People’s Harbor Marled Ribbed Beanie will do a better job of keeping you warm and cozy in the cold.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fit is another important feature to think about. “The tighter the beanie, the cozier it is, the looser, the easier it is to wear for extended hours,” Parladé says. What you ultimately choose depends on your personal preferences, but Dorough recommends styles with fits that fall somewhere between floppy and snuggly fitting to your head — a good option being one of her picks of the moment, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">J.Crew Brushed Cashmere Beanie</a>. “This way, you can position it how you prefer.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style and Color</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, consider the style and color and how that plays into what you’ll be wearing it with. “It’s always great to have neutrals in your closet that go with everything, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Acne Studios’ Wool Beanie</a>, but don’t be afraid to test out fun colors and prints, too!” Maguire says.

For example, longer beanies without built-in cuffs can be folded and cuffed or worn uncuffed and slouchy. You can pull down and fold to fit snugger to your head or leave extra fabric at the top for some height. “Everyone has different preferences, and sometimes even how you style your hair that day will affect your choice in how to position one,” Dorough says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you wear a beanie with long hair?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The great thing about beanies? They work with practically every hair type, long hair included. “Don’t let any hairstyle you rock prevent you from wearing this season’s It accessory,” says&nbsp; Parladé. “Thicker, curlier hair may need to be larger in size to accommodate, but the beanie's versatility is largely why it’s become a staple of anyone’s wardrobe.” That said, folks with longer hair can wear their beanie however they please — but as an expert style rec, Maguire prefers to keep it clean and simple. “I prefer to just wear my long hair down, or I’ll braid it all to one side,” she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jenna Igneri</a> is a freelance writer and has been working in fashion and beauty media for over a decade.
