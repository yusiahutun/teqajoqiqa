You’re gonna be tempted, you know, the fantasy suites are there for a reason.’ And sexual compatibility is a really big thing, especially if you’re gonna be getting down on a knee and asking someone to marry you,” Jesse explained. “Also, what if the women want to have sex with you? You’re kind of taking it off the table. That was probably the most shocking [moment] because in all honesty, part of me kind of knew how it was going to end.”</p><p>He added: “Zach, we know is extremely thoughtful. He has a very heavy conscience. So he’s going to have to navigate a lot in these final few weeks, and he hopefully won’t ruin it for himself.”</p><p>The sales rep told Us that he’s “happy” at the moment — and the season 5 Bachelor echoed his statement.</p><p>“He tells me that he’s extremely happy,” Jesse concluded. “I think Bachelor Nation is going to be absolutely thrilled at the outcome. I don’t want to speak on behalf of Zach. It was a very difficult journey to get to this point. Everybody up to this point has seen that, but the hardest part is yet to come in Thailand,” he teased. “And it’s all going to end up the way it’s supposed to. Zach tells me that he wouldn’t change anything about it, and he’s thrilled. So if he’s happy, I’m happy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET, with the Women Tell All special airing on Tuesday, March 14, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Hannah Kahn</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BjLOYnKBdo7xuv8SxZKKmXam1pnnFmqWtmaOuerTByK2cZqqlobJursitnKxlnZp6qrqMrZ%2BeZZGowHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./filipino-women-and-their-palestinian-spouses-find-hope-metro-manilas-little-gaza.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Filipino women and their Palestinian spouses find hope in Metro Manilas Little Gaza</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./louise-chen.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Louise Chen dating?
