However,&nbsp;the singer himself really didn't take an interest in country music until he was in high school.</p><p>Born May 18, 1952, the now-icon entered the world in Poteet, Texas, as son to Doris and John Strait. He was a big fan of&nbsp;news radio and the farmer's report as a teen — his family owned a huge ranch and he helped out, so he always wanted to stay in the know.</p><p>Strait's career in music&nbsp;started while he was a student at&nbsp;Pearsall High School, where he performed in a rock&nbsp;'n roll garage band known as the Stoics. When he left for college, he kept on that path, joining up with the country band Stoney Ridge after answering&nbsp;a flyer the band posted&nbsp;on campus&nbsp;seeking&nbsp;a new vocalist.</p><p>As the new frontman, Strait&nbsp;renamed the group the Ace in the Hole Band&nbsp;and quickly became the leader.&nbsp;The group played&nbsp;different honky-tonks and bars around south and central Texas.</p><p>In 1981, MCA Records came calling, and Strait signed with them and released his first-ever single, "Unwound." It was a major commercial success, becoming a Top 10 song in country music at the time.</p><p>As Strait's star shined brighter, he decided to try acting: The singer scored&nbsp;a part in the 1982 film&nbsp;The Soldier. Since then, he has appeared in a few other movies — Pure Country, most notably — and even voiced a character on the animated series&nbsp;King of the Hill.</p><p>There was no stopping this country heartthrob, and by the 1990s, he was a household name and had earned his still-standing title of King of Country Music.</p><p>Strait has amassed&nbsp;more than 60 No. 1 songs in his career and has sold millions of records, worldwide.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>40 Photos of George Strait Young</h2><p>George Strait is the undisputed King of Country. With a career spanning over 40 years, he has charted more than 60 No. 1 country songs and has more No. 1 hits than any other artist in a single genre.</p><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: Evan Paul</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Alan Jackson's Spectacular Hilltop Estate</h2><p>After selling their spectacular Southern manor home in 2010, Alan Jackson and his wife moved to to what might be an even more impressive mansion, if that's even possible. Their 5-bedroom, 8-bathroom, 22,012-square-foot estate in the same Nashville suburb of Franklin features bedrooms that are all well-appointed suites, while the formal dining and living areas are finished off with splendid arched doorways, oversized windows and elaborate woodwork. The residence also includes a bar, a media room and multiple indoor and outdoor fireplaces. It sold for $19 million in March of 2021.</p><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: <a href=#>Sterling Whitaker</a></p><h2 class=photogallery-title>The 40 Most-Played Country Songs of the Last 50 Years</h2><p>Country music has come a long way in the last 50 years.
