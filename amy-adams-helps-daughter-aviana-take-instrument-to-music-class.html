Since her daughter was struggling a little bit, Amy helped her out a bit before taking the instrument herself.</p><p>When Aviana was younger, she also took a few ballet classes before discovering it wasn’t for her.</p><p>“I was a dancer, so I sort of talked her into taking ballet,” Amy admitted during a previous appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers. “I want to be a dance mom so bad. I would love it. … But she’s not into performing, so we made a deal that she would not have to do The Nutcracker&nbsp;or recitals.”</p><p>Although Amy respects Aviana’s decision to learn more about music than ballet, she admits she felt a little bit sad her only child won’t be pursuing the art form.</p><p>“It would be really fun to be the mom fighting to the front with my camera, brushing her hair really tight,” she joked. “She’s very good at everything, but she just doesn’t want to be looked at. Silly girl! No, I’m kidding. She’s awesome.”</p><p>Looks like acting’s off the table. At least Aviana gets to spend as much time with her mother when she gets home. One thing Amy has become pretty good at is separating her work and her family life.</p><p>“I tend to wear very little makeup at home because when my daughter was even younger she saw me putting on makeup and she said, ‘You look like Amy Adams when you do that — I just want you to be Mom,'” Amy recalled to the <a href=#>Guardian</a>. “So I said, ‘You got it, honey.’”</p><p><strong>Scroll below to see pics of Amy taking Aviana to music class!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46apLJlkZmurr%2BMoZylqKNisaLBxqGrnqpdlsOqrc2aZK2Zm5p6qrrSramupZWjwW7AzmakrquZmHqkuMCsqmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./366445-courses-offered-adventist-university-africa-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Courses offered at Adventist University of Africa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./superstar-galloper-golden-sixtys-future-remains-air-after-champions-mile-defeat.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Superstar galloper Golden Sixtys future remains up in the air after Champions Mile defeat | HK Ra</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
