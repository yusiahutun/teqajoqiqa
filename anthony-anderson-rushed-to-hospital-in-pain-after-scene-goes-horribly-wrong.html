The <a href=#>celebrity</a> said he underwent several tests and scans after the <a href=#>health</a> scare. The <a href=#>movie</a> star, known for his roles in Kangaroo Jack, Barbershop and Transformers, appeared to be in good spirits despite the knock back.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-anthony-anderson-rushed-to-hospital-after-getting-injured-on-set>Anthony Anderson rushed to hospital after getting injured on set</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1845878720-1024x744.jpg><p>Anthony Anderson shared a photo of him on a hospital bed, smiling and showing a peace sign. He appeared a little worse for wear but still in high spirits. The crew are currently in Cape Town, South Africa filming the new movie.</p><p>The <a href=#>TV</a> actor told fans: “I spend the night in the emergency room.</p><p>“Movie set fight gone wrong. Me against two goons and a chair! Guess who didn’t win! Who needs a stuntman? Me, that’s who!</p><p>“I’m not as young as I used to be! CT Scan and X-rays showing nothing fractured or broken in my back, just a deep contusion. That chair will never be the same, though!</p><p>“Bloodied and bowed, but never broken!”</p><p>A contusion, or bruise, occurs when the body suffers a direct blow. It can <a href=# rel=nofollow>cause</a> damage to the skin, or deeper tissues, depending on how hard the blow was. They can be painful and lead to swelling, although it often gets better at home with rest.</p><p>The star is currently filming for his upcoming movie, G20. The action flick, directed by Patricia Riggen, is a thriller revolving around terrorists who try to siege the annual G20 summit. Viola Davis is also on the bill, playing President Taylor Sutton. Other stars cast include Charlie’s Angels star Ramon Rodriguez and The Boys’ Antony Starr.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-jokingly-shares-photo-of-the-chair>He jokingly shares photo of the ‘chair’</h2><p>The comedy star also shared a photo of the chair that is at fault for Anthony Anderson’s hospital visit.</p><p>He wrote: “This is the chair that whooped my a** last night!</p><p>“Something about it is menacing. It sucker-punched me in the kidneys and back with no mercy.</p><p>“When I got on set today it was grinning at me. Little does he know I got something for that a**. He gone learn today!”</p><p>The star has a busy schedule. It was only 16 days ago he was in LA hosting the Primetime Emmys.</p><p>But it may be a small setback for the production crew, as the film had already been delayed due to the Hollywood writer’s strike and only began filming last month.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2V%2FcK3NrZ%2Bopqlirq%2BwxKuqqKZdp8K0tMSdZK2nXZ28tLzIrZilZZmjerGtyKdkmp6kmr9uv8KepZ5ll6SytHnHqKmroZKhxm7D0ailoGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./strictly-giovanni-pernice-molly-brown-engagement-rumours-clarified.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Giovanni Pernice and Molly Brown's reported engagement addressed after ring photo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./546062-the-neighborhoods-chicago-families-stay.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The best neighborhoods in Chicago for families to stay in 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
