But that doesn’t mean fashion lovers have to sit out an entire season (or longer). It is absolutely possible to create great-looking maternity outfits without having to purchase an entirely new wardrobe of oversized items. Yes, comfort is still key, but that no longer means sticking solely to baggy pants and tent dresses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To break out of the usual maternity outfit rut, we reached out to personal stylist and mother of two Jamie Lewis to help guide us toward more flattering fits and statement pieces. “Clothing in the maternity section of a store can be limiting,” she cautions, “So I advise my clients to keep an open mind when browsing in other departments. With a few styling tricks, most garments have the potential to carry you through the majority of the pregnancy.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether or not you choose to wear actual items of maternity clothing, Lewis has several styling tips that work for both maternity outfits and every day. Of course, bottoms with elastic bands, like joggers, silk pants, and slip skirts will become your go-to, as they can transition throughout each trimester. But try leaving your blouses unbuttoned more and have a bralette peek through, or make it super easy with a thin, stretchy knit dress that you can just throw on and go.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“No matter what, you don’t need to purchase maternity-only clothing,” explains Lewis, who says it’s not realistic for most wardrobes. Ahead, get inspired to shop your closet (and purchase a few special pieces, maybe!), to create maternity outfits that suit your needs, both physically and fashionably, for the duration of your gestation.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Jamie Lewis </a>is a personal stylist and mother of two based in N.Y.C.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-sneakers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With Sneakers</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Who says maternity outfits can’t be chic and comfortable at the same time? Take a note from this style star by pairing a knit dress and similarly colored trench with your favorite fashion sneakers. When you look this polished, even people who aren’t pregnant will want to copy your look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for shoes, Lewis encourages her clients, particularly during pregnancy, to consider sneakers as if they were your go-to flats or loafers. “Now is the time to invest in the shoes you’ll be wearing regularly. You want all the comfort possible, especially on your feet,” she explains. “Wearing sporty shoes with a fitted knit dress still allows you to be completely comfortable but still look put together.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-a-blazer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With a Blazer</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Evening attire can get tricky as pregnancy progresses. But you don’t have to buy a maternity-specific outfit for an upscale event. Instead, try wearing a draped or flowy dress with a simple, oversized blazer. The layering adds dimension without making it appear like you are constricted or camouflaging your baby bump.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-matching-set></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Matching Set</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When in doubt, reach for a matching set,” instructs Lewis. Think of them as posh pajamas: Look for a comfortable material like linen or cotton, and pick a print or pattern that isn’t too precious. Use complementary accessories to give the look a nudge into a particular aesthetic, like preppy or glam. And, if you'd like to show off more of the bump, Lewis suggests adding a fun tank underneath and leaving the top unbuttoned. Everyone’s about to be envious of your maternity style savvy.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-add-a-belt></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Add a Belt</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One might think that belts and baby bumps do not mix. But, as this photo demonstrates, this idea could not be further from the truth. A properly positioned belt draws attention — in a good way — to your growing belly. We love how this style star added a skinny black belt to her knit dress and chicly draped her jacket over her shoulders. Try this outfit with non-maternity clothes for a body-hugging fit, or with a more voluminous dress if it suits the occasion.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-keep-it-colorful></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Keep It Colorful</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Put any preconceived notions about matronly maternity wear aside and embrace every unexpected color of the rainbow. This pastel orange minidress paired with a lovely lavender purse doesn’t scream, “I’m expecting,” but rather, “Expect the unexpected.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>“A colorful outfit is honestly a mood enhancer,” says Lewis. “I love picking just a few colors for a single outfit. Sticking to a story like the peach dress and lilac bag here makes it feel more curated and well thought-out,”. She explains. Plus, bright colors are an instant mood booster.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-add-some-bling></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Add Some Bling</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Presumably, all eyes will be drawn to your baby bump at some point. So why not add something else to attract their attention? Add some bling, like a glittery brooch or cocktail jewelry to your look. It’s a great conversation piece that has nothing to do with dissecting your birth plan.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bold-boots></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bold Boots</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If translating your personal style to your maternity outfits seems a bit impractical, try adding a bit of panache with a pair of colorful boots. We love these red leather knee-highs paired with a simple belted shirt dress. Just make sure to select a shoe with a stacked or wedge heel for guaranteed comfort and all-day support.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-floor-grazing-coat></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Floor-Grazing Coat:</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unless it’s 90 degrees out, outerwear is the easiest way to amp up the style factor for any maternity outfit. Look for a long coat or duster in a fun fabric, and feel free to leave it open. We love how this stylish mother-to-be created a Western, boho vibe with suede boots, long beaded necklaces, and a wide-brimmed hat.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-crochet-all-day></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Crochet All Day</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A well made crochet dress can make for a fantastic maternity outfit and is an easy way to add more texture to any look. “Feel free to go bold with the crochet details, like the shoulders on this dress,” says Lewis. “Remember: Bigger is better when it comes to crochet!” The knit just might even fit from the first trimester all the way to labor day. Plus, perhaps the baby can wear a matching crocheted sweater when he or she arrives.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fun-foliage></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Fun Foliage</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wearing florals during pregnancy is about as groundbreaking as they are for spring. Instead, look for a print that includes lush, green foliage and lean into the more natural, earthy hues. Again, this is a great opportunity to accessorize with an eye-catching belt while keeping shoes and bags in a more neutral, nude hue.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-classic-colorblocking></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Classic Colorblocking</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When in doubt, stick to styling tricks that have stood the test of time. Colorblocking is a simple way to create a maternity outfit that looks put together, even if it happens to be thrown on at the last minute. The easiest option is to have your top and boots match, which is easily done with a black or brown sweater and boots. Try to incorporate a mix of smooth and textured fabrics, like wool and leather, for added visual appeal.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-polka-dots></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Polka Dots</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Face it: Polka dots are just fun. Let your bump take center stage in a midi or maxi polka dot dress, and show off your style savvy with elevated accessories. Consider coordinating your pedicure with your purse, as seen above — bonus points for sporting a bright red lip, too.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-big-reveal></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Big Reveal</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether or not you decide to make the gender reveal of your future baby a social media spectacle, it can be fun to create a maternity outfit that subtly hints at who you’re expecting to add to your family. If sticking to the binary, look for a pink or blue dress with some flare, like the fringe shown here. Or, enhance the suspense by incorporating a variety of vibrant hues into a single outfit. The punchy pink dress would seem to indicate “it’s a girl,” but the emerald green pumps keep everyone guessing.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-touch-of-neon></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Touch of Neon</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There’s nothing like a pop of neon to add some excitement to an everyday maternity outfit. Create a whole week's worth of looks by styling your go-to maternity jeans with a simple top and a lime green blazer, or stick to a neutral color pallet with just one or two electric accessories. People might just ask where you got your jacket before they inquire when you’re due.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-cropped-leather-jacket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Cropped Leather Jacket</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Kirstin Sinclair/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An oversized moto or bomber jacket can add unwanted heft when worn with a maternity outfit. But a cute cropped leather jacket easily bridges the gap between your badass personal style and growing baby bump. Choose a cut that hits closer to the middle (and eventually, the top) of your belly for an ideal yet flexible fit.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-matching-accessories></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Matching Accessories</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some people (like yours truly) gravitate towards wearing head-to-toe black. If your maternity outfits tend to trend towards monochrome, try experimenting with matching accessories of a different color. Wearing a blue belt and handbag with a black dress seems like a no, but looks like a definite yes — and keeps ‘em guessing.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-a-bralette></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With a Bralette</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you reach a point where getting dressed from head to toe no longer feels like a comfortable option, give yourself permission to let your belly breathe. We love how this style star paired comfortable shorts and an unbuttoned denim shirt with a simple black bikini top. It’s an outfit that’s just as edgy whether or not your baby bump is on display.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-all-white></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>All White</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Long white dresses aren’t just reserved for walking down the aisle. We especially love the look for a maternity outfit that meets the criteria for eveningwear. Seek out a white dress that includes expandable materials like stretch fabric, Lycra, or elastane that will hug your curves without squeezing your skin. Go for gold accessories for an ultra-glam look, or try something silver for a more ethereal vibe.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-bodycon-onesie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Bodycon Onesie</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>JOCE/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lewis is a big fan of embracing the bump. “This might be one of the few times when you feel your cutest wearing a bodycon outfit,” she says. Try thinking of stretchy one-piece outfits the same way you’d style a knit dress — just a bit more playful. When it’s cold, Lewis suggests adding a cropped sweatshirt and chunky socks for a fun and cozy take on the athleisure-inspired maternity outfit.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-tube-top></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Tube Top</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Think a tube top is too tricky to wear during pregnancy? Think again; it actually can be quite comfortable. Look for a ribbed or knit fabric (as opposed to something more rigid like t-shirt material), that can expand as needed, and pair it with more voluminous bottoms, like parachute pants, a flowy skirt, or your favorite wide-leg jeans. Classic accessories, like a black leather handbag and chic sunglasses, help to make this maternity outfit a style statement that even your non-pregnant friends will want to replicate.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-silky-pajamas></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Silky Pajamas</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>David M.

And that’s perfectly fine, especially when you have a set of silk pajamas on hand. Über-stylish creative director and fashion designer Julia Restoin Roitfeld proves just how versatile a chic pair of printed PJs can be. Use a single button to create a plunging neckline, and leave the rest open to show off your growing bump. Allow a pretty bralette to peek through, and add a few layers of long necklaces, especially if it’s an evening event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJqrnqqensG6ec6uq5%2BhpKh6eIWWaWttaQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./exclusive-vicky-kaushal-kiara-advani-start-shooting-shashank-khaitan-s-mr-lele-read-deets-674988.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>EXCLUSIVE: Vicky Kaushal &amp;amp; Kiara Advani start shooting for Shashank Khaitans Mr. Lele; Read Deets</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./st-tropez-hotels.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The best luxury hotels in St Tropez</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
