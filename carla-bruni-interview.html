She calls him “my man.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That would be Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France. Take these moments, for instance: “Even when my man was the president, I’d take the Metro and go anywhere,” Bruni says of her life in Paris, enjoying a luxurious French puff from an e-cigarette. (“This is what you use if you want to get rid of the addiction,” she explains.) As for his vices, “my man doesn’t drink at all. He’s never had a sip of alcohol in his life,” Bruni says. “He’s just never tasted it. It’s better for me when I don’t drink either.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To stay in shape, “I do barre, Pilates, yoga. When I was younger I would just sit around smoking and eat McDonald’s. But I get embarrassed when I’m out of shape. I wouldn’t care if I wasn’t a public person, but I still get people photographing me. My man does it a lot too.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ask Bruni if she misses being la Première dame—Sarkozy lost a comeback bid last year—and she responds, “Not at all. It was really nice. I wouldn’t say it was fun, but it was a fantastic time. Five years of adventure. But I don’t miss it. The media, the press, and the job—it’s just brutal. It was most frightening for my man. When you’re president they want to kill you all the time. At the beginning I was like, ‘This is so funny.’ And then I was like, ‘Oh, my God, this is so dangerous!’ It was a great honor, but I was relieved.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In her youthful years as a fashion model, Bruni, the Italian tire heiress daughter of a concert pianist and a composer, dated what she describes as a “normal” number of men. Among them were Mick Jagger; Eric Clapton; the French publisher Jean-Paul Enthoven; and his son, the philosopher Raphaël Enthoven. She and Raphaël were together for seven years and have a son, Aurélien, now 16.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“It was a fantastic time. Five years of adventure. But I don’t miss it.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But it was the president of France who stole her heart. After less than three months of courtship, the pair married, in February 2008. Bruni says she knew immediately that he was the one. “It was like in a fairy tale. It never happened to me before,” she says. “It’s luck. Love doesn’t happen so easily.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bruni, who began pursuing music full-time in 1997, released her first album, Quelqu’un M’a Dit (“Someone Told Me”) in 2002. She expected that it would sell only “two copies—one to my mom and one to my sister”—but it ended up selling more than two million. This fall, she plans to hit the road again and hopes Sarkozy will come along. “He loves it,” she says. “And he’s more flexible because he got another job.” (He is now on the board of directors of AccorHotels, a multinational hospitality group based in France.) “I told him, ‘Stop taking all this work, now that we have a little cool time.’ But he cannot be without work, so he works even more. It’s a new life, which is so cool, because he’s 62.” (Bruni is 49; their daughter, Giulia, is five.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bruni, for her part, hasn’t stopped working either. In October, she will release a new album, a collection of stripped-down, almost folk-like covers, produced with the help of the composer- producer David Foster, featuring her take on classic numbers like Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day,” Tammy Wynette’s “Stand By Your Man,” and the Rolling Stones’ “Miss You.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I sent Mick the song by e-mail for him to agree, and he was like, ‘Yeah, I like it,’” says Bruni, who today is wearing a fitted T-shirt emblazoned with Keith Richards’ face. There’s even a cover of AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell,” one of the few songs on the album that resonate with her teenage son. “He’s okay with Mommy’s music, but he falls asleep a little bit,” she says. Her kids “only see me as their mother; they don’t even see that I’m working. That’s the difference between a man and a woman. If a man is a songwriter, the door is closed, and his girl stands in front of the door being like, ‘Daddy’s working.’ But me, they don’t care. They just go, ‘I’m hungry.’ I’m like, ‘Hey, I have a job, okay?’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At home she and Sarkozy are like a typical couple. She tries to get him to listen to the Clash; he’s partial to Elvis. They watch TV together: “We more or less love anything,” says Bruni. She makes dinner most nights—“I lazily cook pasta”—or they order in. All in all, “I’ve been very lucky,” she says, smiling, and takes a final haul from her mint-flavored vape. “Maybe I did something good in a past life.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>This article originally appears in the September 2017 issue of Harper's BAZAAR.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaaaWJlfnV%2BkXFmnJmioa5urtGupaJlmaPBpr7VopywZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./362661-udom-online-application-20202021-admissions-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>UDOM online application for 2020/2021 admissions</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./19-enigmatic-facts-about-cerina-vincent.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>19 Enigmatic Facts About Cerina Vincent</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
