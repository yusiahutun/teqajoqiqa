Jury members were shown a receipt dated August 30, 1997, from the Paris branch of jewellery store Alberto Repossi which lists the piece as <i>bague fiancaille</i> or engagement ring. The gold and diamond ring, which was later found at Dodi's flat in the French capital, was from the <i>Dis-moi oui</i> – 'Tell me yes' – range.</p><p id=e_Jp3kLnRGgw data-wc=25>Also recorded on the receipt was the purchase of a £60,000 <i>etoile</i> - or star – ring of gold and 'gems' from the same line.</p><p id=e24SlfkZNqEQ data-wc=41>The jury was also shown CCTV footage of Dodi in the store, where he was seen inspecting several pieces of jewellery. Later he is shown carrying only a Repossi brochure back to the Ritz hotel where Diana had spent the afternoon.</p><p id=eOTlG-h-GMqn data-wc=40>Shortly afterwards, however, the hotel president's assistant Claude Roulet was captured on film returning to the store and picking up a bagged item which he took back to the couple's Imperial Suit and then deposited in the Ritz's strong room.</p><p id=ekgBJj6h4yed data-wc=82>Mohammed Al Fayed maintains that his son and the princess had met jewellery firm owner Mr Repossi earlier in the summer in Monte Carlo to select a ring, which was then sent to Italy to be sized. The Harrods boss, who was not at the High Court on Thursday, has also said he received a phone call from Dodi hours before the car crash to confirm he'd picked up the ring and that Diana had spoken to him about making an announcement.</p><p id=ezWKStnLoNoD data-wc=33>The coroner told the jury: "You will have to decide whether Dodi did indeed phone his father in those terms and whether, if he did, what he said was more than wishful thinking".</p><p id=e_JwyOX3fpJh data-wc=56>Diana's friends and family have always insisted she wasn't engaged nor was she planning to re-marry. The inquest heard from the Princess' close friend Lady Annabel Goldsmith who spoke to her about marriage not long before she passed away. "I need marriage like a rash on the face," Diana is said to have replied to her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/legacy/royalty/2007/10/19/diana-dodi-ring/imgs/dodi-1a.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/legacy/royalty/2007/10/19/diana-dodi-ring/imgs/dodi-2a.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfp7y6rcutsGhqYGWEcnyQcmhybWZlgHCwyJqlmmWUpLGqedGipaBn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./did-jennifer-lawrence-use-body-double-famous-nude-beach-fight-no-hard-feelings-actress-said-scene-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Jennifer Lawrence use a body double as she stripped naked in No Hard Feelings?
