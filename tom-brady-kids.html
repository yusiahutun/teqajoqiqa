Brady, who holds the record for the most Super Bowl wins in NFL history, is the quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and shares three kids with his wife Gisele Bündchen and his ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan.</p><p>Moynahan, an actress best known for her role in Blue Bloods, dated Brady from 2004 to 2006. Moynahan’s representative confirmed their split to People, telling the magazine that the two broke up on good terms.</p><p>“[They] amicably ended their three-year relationship several weeks ago. We ask for your respect and consideration of their privacy,” the statement read. That same year, Brady started <a rel=noopener href=#>dating Bündchen</a>, a <a rel=noopener href=#>Victoria’s Secret angel</a> at the time, whom a mutual friend introduced him to on a blind date. “I knew right way–the first time I saw him,” the model told <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Vanity Fair</a> in 2009, describing Brady’s “beautiful, charismatic smile” and how they talked for three hours.</p><p>A few months into <a rel=noopener href=#>Bündchen and Brady’s relationship</a>, Moynahan announced that she was pregnant with Brady’s baby. She gave birth to their son, John Edward Thomas Moynahan, in August 2007. Two years after his first child’s birth, <a rel=noopener href=#>Brady married Bündchen</a> in a small wedding at St. Monica Catholic Church in Santa Monica, California. The two had a second wedding in Costa Rica a few months later. Bündchen and Brady welcomed their first child together, a son named Benjamin Rein, in 2009. Their second child, a daughter named Vivian Lake, was born in 2012. Here’s what we know about Tom Brady’s kids.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=tom-brady-s-kids>Tom Brady’s kids</h2><p>He told the SiriusXM podcast <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Let’s Go! With Tom Brady, Larry Fitzgerald and Jim Gray</a> “We have unique challenges for our own kids. We try to teach them the right values and so forth,” adding, “Whether I’m at a game for my son—and I love doing that—but, you know, a lot of times the attention gets shifted to us,” Brady continued. “I don’t want to take away from their moments because this is an important part of their life and their maturation.”</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11.607558139535><h2>John "Jack" Moynahan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Born: August 22, 2007</p><p>Jack, whose full name is John Edward Thomas Moynahan, is Brady’s first child and the only kid he shares with his ex-girlfriend, Bridget Moynahan. Brady’s wife, Gisele Bündchen, calls Jack her “bonus son.” In an interview with More magazine in 2011, Moynahan revealed that Brady wasn’t in the delivery room with her when she gave birth. “He was there on that day and came in afterwards. He certainly wasn’t holding my hand while I pushed,” she said.</p><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2020 that Brady’s eldest son “loves football” and has already taken an interest in playing. “Tom and Jack are super tight,” the source said. “He loves football. Tom’s very active with him. He’s always spotted out with him. Parents have seen him playing football in the schoolyard with Jack and his classmates.”</p><p>In an interview on The Howard Stern Show in 2020, Brady opened up about whether he would want his children to be athletes like him. “I would never want for them to be ‘Tom Brady’s son’ playing football. I don’t like that at all,” he said. “But from a team, camaraderie, discipline, I think there’s something about contact sports that teaches you a lot about discipline, respect, mutual respect for your opponent that you don’t get in non-contact sports.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=12.046485260771><h2>Benjamin Brady</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Born: December 8, 2009</p><p>Benjamin, whose is nicknamed Benny, is Brady’s second son and his first child with Bündchen. In an interview with Men’s Health in 2019, Brady said it was “hard” when Benny, whose full name is Benjamin Rein Brady, told him that he isn’t interested in sports, unlike his half-brother, Jack. “He wants to try hard, and he never wants to disappoint his dad,” Brady said. “Gisele kept saying to me, ‘Would you effing understand that your son is different? The reality is that Benny just likes different things. And it’s great because now I just have to go do what he wants to do. When we do that, we have the best time. He’s like, ‘OMG, Dad, you’re so funny.’ He loves joking, and I joke back.”</p><p>In an <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> post for Benny’s 9th birthday in 2018, Brady described his middle child as a “beautiful, loving, sweet son.” “Our sweet Benny, 9 years ago you were born and what a blessing you have been. You are such a beautiful, loving, sweet son that we always knew you would be!” he wrote. “We are lucky parents to have you in our life and you always put a smile on everyone’s face when you are around! First present is some bigger boxing gloves because I can’t take those shots anymore! 🤣❤️💯”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.2620396600567><h2>Vivian Brady</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Born: December 5, 2012</p><p>Vivian’s full name is Vivian Lake Brady.
