The late <a href=#>celebrity</a> artist died of lymphoma on July 4, 1995. He reportedly had two children although his son, Steve Ross, is most publicly known. He was named as his father’s successor but Steve claims that Bob’s business partners betrayed his father’s intended legacy as they exercised control after his death.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-50467807-1024x677.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bob-ross-s-son-lost-lawsuit-for-company-ownership>Bob Ross’s son lost lawsuit for company ownership</h2><p>Bob Ross’s likeness continues to be plastered on merchandise, videos, and even a scene in Marvel’s Deadpool, thanks to the work of Bob Ross Inc (BRI) – the company behind the painter’s brand.</p><p>However, Steve Ross claims his father’s name and image have been exploited against his wishes by Annette and Walt Kowalski, the couple who propelled him to fame in the 1980s. BRI was founded as an equal partnership between the Kowalskis, and Bob and his second wife, Jane. Upon Jane’s death, her shares were distributed among the parties equally, meaning Ross was a minority shareholder.</p><p>In his final few months, the painter reportedly altered his will to specify that his “name, likeness, voice, and visual, written, or otherwise recorded work” would go to his son and his half-brother Jimmie Cox.</p><p>Steve <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recalled</a> to Daily Beast about a 1995 phone call that stuck with him. “Annette called me two days after my dad died, and she said, ‘I want you to listen to me carefully… Any Bob Ross art products, anything related to art or painting… you can never ever make those, distribute those, create a business around those—nothing’,” he said.</p><p>“‘But if you would like you can do anything not painting- or art-related that you want. You can do Bob Ross pickles, Bob Ross shoes, Bob Ross whatever. But you cannot put the Ross name on a painting- or art-related product, period – ever – for the rest of your life’,” Ross added.</p><p>20 years after Bob’s passing, Steve filed a lawsuit to reassert control of BRI. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According</a> to The Blast, he claimed he owned 100 per cent of the rights to his father’s name. Steve lost the case and an undisclosed settlement between the parties ended the appeal.</p><p>The 2021 Netflix documentary titled Bob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal & Greed detailed the legal battle over Ross’s legacy, featuring interviews with Steve. But accounts by BRI representatives weren’t provided.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-50467806-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bob-ross-inc-responded-to-netflix-s-inaccurate-portrayal-of-their-company>Bob Ross Inc responded to Netflix’s ‘inaccurate portrayal’ of their company</h2><p>BRI posted a public <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a> the same day the documentary was released. The multi-million dollar brand called the film “inaccurate and heavily slanted,” before asserting that Netflix contacted them with “lack of transparency.”</p><p>“The final narrative lacks considerable nuance and accuracy and carries a clear bias in favor of those who were interviewed,” they wrote.</p><p>Bob Ross Inc claims they reached out to filmmakers three months before release but no communication was returned except through an attorney. BRI said their comprehensive statement was excluded from the final cut.</p><p>The statement continued: “Many of these baseless accusations attempt to relitigate claims brought against Bob Ross Inc in 2017 by RSR Art LLC, a company owned by Steve Ross, Dana Jester and Lawrence Kapp, all of whom appear in the film.”</p><p>RSR Art LLC’s claims were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rejected</a> by a judge in 2019.</p><p>BRI has been led by Annette and Walt’s daughter, Joan Kowalski, since 2012.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2eGcK7Om2Srp6OoerS8xKerZqCZqHqtrdKtZJ2Zqah6p7XGoauippdis6q6wKVkmp%2Bfo8ZuwM5mop6doGK1qr%2BMpZygmZOueqK4yK%2BcaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-wear-white-shoes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Wear White Shoes: 40 Outfits to Copy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./princess-margaret-peter-townsend-royal-love-affair-timeline.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Timeline of Their Royal Love Affair</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
