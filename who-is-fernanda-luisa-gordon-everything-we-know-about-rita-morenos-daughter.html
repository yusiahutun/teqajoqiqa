My baby was giving birth to a baby,” she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rita-Moreno.jpg><p>In 2023, Justin was honored to accompany Moreno to TIME’s Women of the Year Gala.
