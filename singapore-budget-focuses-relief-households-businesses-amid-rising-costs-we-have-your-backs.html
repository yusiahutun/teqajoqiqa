For example, in November last year, Japan announced that it would allocate 2 trillion yen, or about S$18 billion, to support its semiconductor industry,” he said.</p><p datatype="p"

of 40 will also get a S$4,000 top-up of SkillsFuture credits – the state’s education and training initiative for adults – while younger citizens will receive the top-up when they turn 40, Wong said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The S$4,000 credit would be “more targeted in scope”, said Wong, and users would be confined to selected training programmes that had “better employability outcomes”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Singaporeans aged over 40 will also be given

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A training allowance will also be given to Singaporeans who enrol in these full-time courses, equivalent to half of one’s latest average income but capped at S$3,000 per month.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This must be our shared commitment to one another – to help our fellow Singaporeans develop to their fullest potential, and to have productive and meaningful careers,” Wong said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On how the government planned to deal with its ageing population, Wong said it would set aside S$3.5 billion for Age Well SG – a programme to support senior citizens as they age.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The money will go into a range of initiatives over the next decade, such as developing more assisted-living options and amenities at residential estates to allow seniors to live more independently and safely in the community.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

report</span></a> – the result of a nationwide feedback exercise with some 200,000 citizens.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The initiative, which covered challenges and proposals on nearly every aspect of Singaporean life, was largely viewed as the first concrete sign of an impending change in leadership for the republic – its third since independence in 1965 – and described as a “primer” and “election manifesto” by political observers who earlier spoke to This Week in Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As part of Forward Singapore, we are making significant policy shifts to strengthen our social safety nets, and provide more assurance to Singaporeans,” Wong said on Friday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The government will spend about S$5 billion on Forward Singapore policies for the 2024 financial year, and close to S$40 billion in total by the end of the decade.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=#

additional S$600 in vouchers for all Singaporean households to be dished out in two phases, on top of a so-called Cost-of Living payment of between S$200 and S$400, depending on income and properties owned.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This brings the value of the Assurance Package up by S$1.9 billion, from the estimated S$10.1 billion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have designed the Assurance Package so that lower-income families get more support. We have also ensured that larger households, particularly those with seniors and children, get more support,” Wong said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There will also be a personal income tax rebate of 50 per cent for the assessment year of 2024, capped at S$200. Wong said the rebate would cost the administration S$350 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/16/88f401e1-3219-4910-afeb-183a2707b1ee_f60200c9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also revealed a rebate to cushion the impact of the property tax changes this year, adding there would be another rebate in 2025 if necessary.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In his 2022 budget speech, Wong had rolled out a two-step increase in property tax rates for homes. This was aimed as a “wealth tax” on investment properties and higher-end segments of owner-occupied private properties.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, rents surged from 2022, leading to annual values increasing sharply, which resulted in the proportion of affected owner-occupied properties nearly doubling to 13 per cent, instead of the initially expected 7 per cent, he said.</p>The budget speech was <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Wong</span></a>’s third, and possibly last, before Prime Minister <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Lee Hsien Loong</span></a> hands over power as the country heads into its next general election. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/11/05/20231105-SG-Clip.00_00_26_32.Still001.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:04</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Singapore’s PM Lee feels ‘great fortune, honour’ ahead of power transition to Lawrence Wong</p><p>Singapore’s PM Lee feels ‘great fortune, honour’ ahead of power transition to Lawrence Wong</p>But whether the perks from this year’s budget were enough to “make up for the dents to trust and confidence of recent controversies” remained to be seen, SMU’s Tan said, referring to the spate of rare <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">high-level controversies</span></a> that hit the ruling People’s Action Party last year.More recently, former transport minister <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">S.
