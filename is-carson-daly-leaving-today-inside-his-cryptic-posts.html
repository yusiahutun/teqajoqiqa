Cryptic comments shared on his Instagram page have led viewers to question if he is looking to announce a huge career move.</p><h2>Carson Daly Has Been a TV Personality for More Than 3 Decades</h2><p>Carson became a cohost on Today in 2013 after years of experience as the host of TRL on MTV. While balancing his duties as a morning TV personality, he has also been hosting The Voice since season 1 in 2011.</p><p>In July 2017, the NBC star announced he was stepping down from his radio show to spend more time with <a href=#>his family</a>.</p><p>“Today is my very last day on AMP radio … The truth is … the reason I’m going to stop doing radio for now is that I just want to have breakfast with my kids,” he wrote on Instagram at the time. “I want to thank you guys. It’s been really incredible.”</p><p>Carson is a dad to kids Jackson, Etta, London and Goldie, whom he shares with <a href=#>wife <strong>Siri Daly</strong></a>.</p><p>“It’s just time,” he reflected. “Anybody who knows me knows I work and travel a ton. I felt it was time for something to give. I want to spend more time with my kids, my wife. Eat breakfast with them and drive them to school. Of all the jobs I have, being a father is far and away the most important to me. It’s time to put family first. Life is moving at warp speed. I don’t want to miss any of it at home.”</p><h2><strong>Is Carson Daly Leaving ‘Today’?</strong></h2><p>In January 2024, Carson shared a slew of mysterious quotes in his Instagram Stories without any explanation.</p><p>“Six months from now, you’re going to look back at your life and say, ‘I really did believe in myself, and it worked,'” one quote said, while another read, “You can literally feel in your soul when it’s TIME. Time to move on from people, time to make a change in your life, time to get rid of unhealthy habits, time to want MORE for yourself. At some point, you’ll just know.”</p><p>So far, Carson has not made any official announcement about leaving Today or The Voice. He shared another quote after broadcasting on Today on January 29: “You’ve mastered the art of bouncing back, now it’s time to master not having to.”</p><p>Earlier in the month, the producer jetted off to Los Angeles to attend the Emmy Awards. He had a viral moment with The Bear’s <strong>Ayo Edebiri</strong> in the audience when she asked him to hold her purse as she accepted the award for Outstanding Supporting Actress.</p><p>“When you win an Emmy, what you don’t know is you get whisked away to the back for quite some time. So I had her purse, her iPhone and a small little actual [digital] camera for about an hour,” Carson recalled of the moment once he returned to Today. “Ayo’s phone though — it was locked of course, but I was able to get into the camera. I may have left her a little Easter egg. If she checks her camera, I don’t know … maybe that will be there, we’ll see.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46iqmabkafAsLqMnZilsV2hsqLCyKeeZqyfma66ecinqqKclWK1qr%2BMnKmyqKSesG68zqyrrGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./43-facts-about-jackie-chan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>43 Facts about Jackie Chan</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./new-songs-on-the-radio-october-2012.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>New Songs on the Radio October 2012</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
