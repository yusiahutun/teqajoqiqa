his notes: 'If the relationship was over, why get on [the] bike?'</span></p><p><span>'Why would she say she expected the relationship to continue if the motor crash didn't occur,' Mr Long also wrote down as one of his questions for the coach.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>No answer was listed for either in the notes.</span></p><p><span>In the end, Mr Long was unable to overlook Petrino's repeated failures to disclose details of his affair, noting the following times in his notes:</span></p><p><span>'You knew when you hired her.'</span></p><p><span>'You knew on Sunday (the day of the crash).'</span></p><p><span>'You knew when I visited you in (the) hospital (the day following the accident).'</span></p><p><span>Mr Long also made a point in his notes to remind Petrino that he hid the affair and a $20,000 Christmas gift before Dorrell was hired.&nbsp;</span></p><img

her summer nuptials to her boyfriend</p><p><span>Dorrell told Mr Long she hid the money under her mattress, then deposited it shortly before buying a new car the week she began her job.</span></p><p><span>According to Mr Long, Petrino said he and Dorrell became friends while she held her former job as a fundraiser for the Razorback Foundation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>They began going to lunch together, and Petrino told his boss that his affair with Dorrell began with a kiss last fall.</span></p><p><span>At one point last October, Petrino and Ms Dorrell were sitting in a car, eating lunch and talking and 'she said are you going to kiss me', according to Mr Long's notes of his April 10 conversation with Petrino.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He then wrote: 'Kissed on lunch outing'.</span></p><p><span>It's unclear when the relationship turned sexual.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Dorrell said the two had been intimate four to six times since around September, and the 'last encounter' was around signing day on Feb. 1, when Petrino showed up via car service at a Little Rock event rather than arriving by plane.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Mr Fagg's notes indicate the two decided they should be only friends sometime in early February.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Petrino told Mr Long that Dorrell was interested in the job, that 'she approached him. Thought she would be good. Understood they would definitely have to stop'.</span></p><p><span>Petrino was fired for failing to disclose his relationship with Dorrell, a former Arkansas volleyball player whom he hired last month without disclosing his conflict of interest or the fact he had once given her the $20,000.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The payment, Mr Long wrote, could make the school 'vulnerable to sexual harassment' lawsuit.</span><br><span>Petrino, Mr Long wrote, 'never thought the gift was a problem or the relationship'. He put two big question marks next to that entry.</span></p><p><span>Dorrell referred to '5-6 gifts' during her interview with Mr Long, according to the notes, and Mr Long said the money was used for the car, wedding expenses and a vacation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There are references to candy gifts - Hot Tamales, specifically - with Dorrell saying she 'got it once before things started' and Mr Long also talked with Josh Morgan, an athletic department employee who has been described as Dorrell's fiancé 'at one point'.</span></p><p><span>'Football gave her a bonus to get a car,' Morgan told Mr Long, according to the notes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The purchase of the black Acura apparently came three days after she was hired.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Dorrell quit her job Tuesday and received $14,000 in what the school described only as a settlement payment.</span></p><p><span>Mr Long wrote a detailed list of contract violations Petrino had committed before meeting with the former coach to discuss them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He included in his notes that he was still looking for Petrino to remain the Arkansas coach, despite those violations, and asked Petrino to 'help me understand why these are not violations of your contract'.</span><span><br></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Fcn%2BRcGpvZ3mperTAwKurnpxdoLa0v4x7ppuaqWKdpsDRoqWoq12itrTA0Z6qrGWjpbKvwIxrZ6Rll56ztXnHqKOinJGuwG7DxJ2boqaXYrK5vMSnqp6rXZazp63Iq2SsrJGnwaawjKWsp5uYqbausYyspKink517qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lupita-nyongo-shows-incredible-figure-tiny-bikini-celebrates-good-times-getaway-cancun-surprise-split-selema-masekela-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lupita Nyong'o shows off her incredible figure in tiny bikini as she celebrates 'good times' during</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-bazaar-commandments-the-rocker-chic-rules.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Dress Like a Rocker Chick</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-hartline-and-lindsay-smith-spouse.html>Brian Hartline and Lindsay Smith (spouse)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-munoz-announces-consejos-gratis-us-tour.html>Eden Muoz Announces Consejos Gratis US Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beijing-trying-create-new-status-quo-sending-balloons-over-taiwan.html>Is Beijing trying to create new status quo by sending balloons over Taiwan?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matilda-lawler.html>Matilda Lawler Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./344785-salman-khan-net-worth-2020-income-property-assets-html.html>Salman Khan net worth 2020: income, property, assets</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
